child-god Balakrishna. The worship of Krishna involved deep personal emotional attachment. It was easy to transfer these motherly emotions to Baby Christ. Small ivory statues of Infant Jesus were created based on the iconography of Balkrishna. Such images of reclining Jesus usually formed a part of bride’s dowry and were associated with seeking blessings of God for progeny.
Adornments have been provided by painting the bracelets and anklets on the wrists and ankles of the
Baby Christ, ornaments which are an almost indispensable part of the images of Baby Krishna.

The appearance of Jujaka is authentically captured by Sayed Ahmad showing Jujaka’s entire ugly feature delineated by the Ajanta artist: the broken front teeth, goatee beard, the bald forehead and spiky hair at the back of his skull, the parrot-like nose and small, uncanny eyes.
A gift from Sir Akbar Hydari.
The Ajanta World heritage site is comprised of numerous Buddhist rock-cut caves, embellished with thousands of square feet of mural paintings and sculptures created between the 2nd century BCE and 650 CE. The present painting is a copy of one of the mural paintings at Ajanta. It was made in the early 1920s by Sayed Ahmed. These copies were commissioned by the department of archaeology of the Hyderabad state and are considered to be the most faithful copies of the original paintings. Since most of the original paintings at Ajanta have decayed due to weather and other elements these copies became more important from the point of view of research.
The copies were made under the supervision of Ghulam Yazdani, an Indian archaeologist. He persuaded Nizam – the ruler of the erstwhile Hyderabad State – to allow him to document the cave paintings of Ajanta. Accordingly, the Department of Archaeology of the Hyderabad State was founded in 1915. Ghulam Yazdani became its first director. Shortly after that Yazdani gave the task of copying of murals to the artist Syed Ahmad. He was trained by a British artists Christiana Herringham and Lady Herringham to copy the frescoes with greater fidelity to the originals. Syed Ahmad achieved a high degree of success in this task of making copies as regards tone is distinctly superior to those made by previous artists like Major R. Gill (1844 – 1866), John Griffiths, and Lady Herringham. During his tenure as a curator of Ajanta caves, some 3,000 paintings were created.

DESCRIPTION
In the year 1935, the 44th Annual Art Exhibition of the Bombay Art Society was held at the Town Hall (Asiatic Society) Bombay and in this exhibition, ‘Mahiyari’, won the Society’s prestigious gold medal of the year to the artist. It depicts a Rajasthani woman resting by her pot of water or curd. It is carried out with a bold cubist touch in the bright colours. The face is exquisitely executed and a light but soft background of sunlit buildings sets off the graceful figure.
Solegaonkar joined Sir J. J. School of Art directly in the fourth year in 1930 and passed the Diploma Examination in Drawing and Painting in 1932, winning the Dolly Cursetji Prize twice during this period. He also worked in the then popular Bombay Revivalist Style under the guidance of the artist J. M. Ahivasi using opaque watercolours inspired by the colouring technique of Indian miniatures. During his professional life, Solegaonkar was deeply impressed by the exotic nature of the Ajanta frescoes and believed that the colours used must have belonged to the immediate environment. He made a point of collecting natural materials available around Ajanta such as coloured mud, stones, leaves, and flowers to produce similar colours. His paintings looked unique because he put in a lot of effort to prepare colours.

22.1015
DESCRIPTION
Mark: seal “Takasaki”; carved inscription Bokusui hen, Inshi koku
This is a superb example of the collaboration among craftsmen of the Meiji period. The body is of shibuichi, an alloy of copper and silver, with applied and carved decoration showing Emma-O, the Buddhist King of Hell, dreaming of a procession of courtesans, a humorous moralistic theme which often appears on metalwork of this period. The dreaming deity is carved in high relief with details in applied copper, shakudo (an alloy of copper and gold which patinates to a luxurious black colour), and gold; the procession of the courtesans and her attendants on the reverse of the incense burner is executed in a similar technique. Exquisite panels of cloisonné enamel on the three legs are possibly the work of Hiratsuka Mohei or Goto Shozaburo, both of whom won prizes for their work. The finial is in the form of a humorous Oni, an ambivalent Buddhist demon, in patinated and gilt copper.
The vase was probably produced to order by the Ozeki Export Company of Yokohama who exhibited work at the First National Industrial Exposition in 1877 where they won prizes. Yamada Motonobu (1847–97), who used the art name “Inshi”, came from a family who had served as retainers to the Mito branch of the Tokugawa family. Besides receiving commissioned work from the Ozeki company, Motonobu, who moved to Edo around 1872, is also recorded as having served the imperial household in 1877.

DESCRIPTION
Sir Ratan Tata Art Collection
This detailed, intricate, and beautiful depiction of the magnificent Diwan-i-khas of the Red Fort in Delhi was probably included in the Indian Art Exhibition at Delhi in 1903. This was the time when artists were painting portraits of Mughal
emperors, queens, and princes, and representations of famous architectural sites, for the markets of Delhi and Lucknow. Painters of the later Mughal school tradition at Delhi, Lucknow, Patna, and Banaras especially preferred to paint
on rectangular or oval ivory plaques which were generally used to decorate carved ebony caskets and jewellery boxes.
In the exhibition catalogue, George Watt refers to some exquisite paintings made by artist Muhammad Hussain Khan on ivory and paper. This artist won the silver medal for his entries, which included portraits and interiors of famous monuments at Agra, Delhi, and Amritsar. These may be the works purchased by Sir Ratan Tata that are now in the Museum. The 15 paintings on ivory consist of architectural studies of the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, the Golden Temple Amritsar, and portrait studies of Mughal begums. The paintings are done in watercolour and gold3 in the European
method of “wash and colour” in which the colour was first dissolved in water. While using gold, the pigment was deposited at the bottom and used by painters when needed.
The painting of the Diwan-i-khas successfully recreates the grandeur of the special audience hall where the Mughal
emperor Shahjahan met his courtiers and important personalities.
The trend of painting monuments on paper started around 1815 in Delhi with topographical drawings of local monuments. Painters worked for local patrons as well as for British officers, among them Thomas Metcalfe – a member of the Archaeological Survey of India who commissioned studies of Delhi monuments. This painting can be compared with one such watercolour painting made on paper by Muzaffar Ali Khan in c. 1840.

22.3232
DESCRIPTION
Script – Arabic, language – Deccani Hindi
Sir Ratan Tata Art Collection
(24 folios)
Chandrabadan Mahar is a romantic love story written in 1626 CE by the poet Mukini of Bijapur. According to the story the hero Mahar falls in love with the princess Chandrabadan. When approached, Chandrabadan and her father insult him. Unable to bear the humiliation, he dies. When Chandrabadan sees the funeral procession of Mahar, her heart fills with love and repentance and she dies of shock. They are cremated together, thus being united only in death.
The painting is an example of continuous narration with the upper register showing the darikhana (courtroom) of Chandrabadan’s father. The king is seated here against a bolster on a chowki (stool)- like throne under a chhatri (parasol). A soldier stands in front of the king with folded hands, probably informing him about Mahar’s presence in the palace.
Porcelain vases are shown in niches in the wall, a common feature of Hyderabadi paintings.
The lower register shows a part of the ladies’ chamber where Chandrabadan is seated against a bolster, accompanied by three maids. Mahar, his lovesick eyes fixed on Chandrabadan, is shown being restrained by a soldier who looks like the one in the register above. Both the registers represent the landscape beyond the palace walls synoptically, by the tops of
three trees.
The colophon page says: “8th of Safar Sana in AH 1115 in spite of illness this story was completed (by the scribe) in Farkhunda Buniyad (Hyderabad).” The scribe, whose name has been blotted out, writes further that he is not hopeful of still being alive the next day but that his writing in black on white will remain alive forever. The text is written in khat e shikast (running hand).
There are many copies of this popular love story in other collections. There was a trend of illustrating Hindu love stories in Hyderabad.
The illustrations in the manuscript do not provide detailed studies of the characters or architecture. As suggested in the colophon, the manuscript seems to have been completed hurriedly for its owner without paying much attention to minute details; this and the lack of gold indicate a lesser rank of the patron of this work. The use of flat colours and the rendering
of the female figures derive from folk painting.

A Group of Nathapanthi Sages,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/22.3464_01_tif.jpg,"A Group of Nathapanthi Sages
22.3464
DESCRIPTION
This large group of sadhus (sages) in the company of devotees provides an interesting source for the study of religious sects in India. Wearing pink robes and hat-like head coverings, these sadhus belong to the Natha Sampradaya, a Shaiva sect founded by Matsyendranatha in the 8th or 9th century. Except for the landscape and the colour of the devotees’ clothing, the compositions are very similar. Some of the important figures in the central group of sages can be identified because of Devanagari inscriptions next to these figures. The person in the centre, wearing a white robe and a conical cap, is identified here as Guru Gorakhnatha. The sages to his left are Raja Bhartrahari and Raja Jalandhara, and the third to his right, slightly bent, is Raja Gopichanda.
The painting is set in the midst of a forest where this group of Nathapanthis has decided to stay awhile. There is a small temple in the background. The group of main sadhus occupies the central space around a fire. Other members of the assembly are on their left, lower left, and top right. They are shown busy with various activities like pounding and straining bhang, a popular intoxicating Indian drink made from the hemp plant, smoking huqqa and chilam (pipe), or having a siesta. Two child sadhus, a sapera (snake charmer), a caged parrot, and dogs are also a part of the group. On the lower right a group of colourfully clothed villagers have come to pay their homage to the sages. Interestingly, a sweet-seller has put up a stall near the river in the hope of some business. A landscape with leafy and dense vegetation,
hillocks, river with lotus flowers, and the inclusion of deer, birds, peacock, hare, and squirrel create a perfect crowded composition suited to the theme.
The Nathapanthis can be identified here with their typical dress code which includes choga – a terracotta-coloured
gown, sota – wooden sticks to ward off evil spirits, and khappar – bowl consisting of a piece of a broken earthen pot. But the most distinct feature is their disk-like earrings, which they wear by tearing the earlobes. The concept behind this was that the rays of the sun should pass through the hole in the ear of the “Wise Brahmin”. Therefore they are popularly known a kanphata (torn-ear) yogis.
The painting’s style presents a combination of Mughal and Rajasthani with some European influence. The washes of colour and various shades of green used to show the depth and variety of vegetation are peculiar to this combined art style.

S 73.5
DESCRIPTION
THE popularity of the image of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti in Kashmir can be attributed to the famous King Jayapida who ruled Kashmir sometime in the 8th century CE. The Rajatarangini of Kalhana records that King Jayapida founded the city of Jayapura, identified by Buhler as Andarkot, situated on the Sambar lake. He built many temples and viharas there. Referring to the installation of Chaturatmana Vishnu it states, “In his own town (of Jayapura) Keshava, showing his quadruple form (Chaturatmana) as well as reclining on the Sesha, has truly taken up his abode, abandoning his residence in Vishnuloka (i.e. Vaikuntha)”.
The idol of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti has become very popular in Kashmir after this as evidenced by a number of icons of this deity belonging to the 8th–10th centuries from this region.
The four faces of Vaikuntha symbolise the Pancharatra concept of four vyuhas. The central human face with long curved eyebrows and closed meditative eyes represents Vasudeva, to its left is the face of Varaha representing Samkarshana and to its right is that of the lion representing Pradyumna. Both these have partially open mouths exposing their teeth and have wide round eyes. All three are adorned with earrings, with crown and other decorations on their heads. The fourth face behind is distinctly different from the other three as it depicts the fierce face of sage Kapila with jatabhara on his head. His angry face has knitted, arched eyebrows and wide open bulging eyes. His mouth, exposing his teeth and the tusks above his lips, add to the fierceness of his face.

DESCRIPTION
Panthera tigris tigris
The white tiger or bleached tiger is a leucistic pigmentation variant of the mainland tiger. Compared to orange tigers these white tigers tend to be larger at birth and as adults. Rewa, a princely state in Central India, was well-known as a centre for breeding white tigers in captivity. The lineage of these white tigers began with a tiger named Mohan, who was captured as a cub in 1951 by Maharaja Shri Martand Singh of Rewa. Mohan died in 1970, aged almost 20. He was the last recorded white tiger born in the wild. The white tigress we have at the museum is Lakshmi, a descendant of Mohan. She was purchased by the Bombay Zoo, the present Veer Mata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan, in 1966, from the Maharaja of Rewa. Like Lakshmi, all the white tigers in various zoos around the world are descendants of Mohan. The only exceptions to this are the three white tigers born in the Orissa Zoo in 1980, to a pair of normal-coloured tigers unrelated to Mohan. The white tiger is listed as endangered under IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and is severely threatened; therefore, the only remaining species are in captivity.

It can easily be distinguished by its black crown on the forehead contrasting with the pale neck and head. The body is brownish, and the wings are marked with black, brown, and grey. The Great Indian Bustard inhabit dry grasslands and scrublands on the Indian subcontinent. It is the state bird of Rajasthan, where the largest populations are found. They are omnivores that feed opportunistically on various arthropods, worms, small mammals, and small reptiles. When the ""national bird"" of India was under consideration, the Great Indian Bustard was a proposed candidate, strongly supported by the Indian ornithologist Salim Ali, but dropped in favour of the Indian peafowl with at least one reason being the potential for being misspelt. Hunting, habitat degradation, collisions with high tension electric wires, fast moving vehicles, feral dogs in villages, grazing cattle and infrastructure development pose some of the most immediate threats to the species’ survival. This species is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Madhu and Malati in the School,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2009.120.jpg,"Madhu and Malati in the School
2009.120
DESCRIPTION
Though there is no inscription, this painting can be identified as an illustration to the romantic story of Madhu and Malati written by poet Chaturbhuj Das sometime in the later part of the 15th century. It attained considerable popularity in
Rajasthan and many illustrated manuscripts of Madhumalati belonging to the 18th and 19th centuries have come to light.
The story centres around princess Malati, daughter of King Chatursena of Lilavati, and Manohar, also named Madhu, the son of Minister Taranshah. The story narrates their love and romance, their separation and agonies, and after a long
struggle, their final meeting.
The scene is set in an architectural background of the courtyard of a school surrounded by a garden. The teacher, seated against a large bolster, is giving instruction to young Madhu who shows his writing board inscribed with “Shri Rama
Shri Krishna Chandra”, to him. Malati, instead of writing these words dictated by the teacher, is lost in her own thoughts and is writing the name of Madhu on her board.
There are three other pupils; all except Malati wear a Vaishnava tilaka mark on their foreheads. The painting also provides a glimpse of the contemporary costume of children in this region. The teacher wears a long gherdar jama and holds a rosary.
Several decorative niches in the wall and an orange rolled-up curtain are usual features of the paintings of this region.

Emergence of Kaushiki,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2009.129.jpg,"Emergence of Kaushiki
2009.129
DESCRIPTION
The painting illustrates an episode from the Devi Mahatmya of the Markandeya Purana (LXXXV, 40). Once when Parvati, the consort of Shiva, went to bathe in the river Ganga, all the gods prayed to her to protect them from the powerful
demons Shumbha and Nishumbha. Parvati split herself into two forms, one form of surpassing beauty called Kaushiki, and the other a fierce dark form, Kali, who temporarily moved away to live in the Himalaya.
The scene is laid against the river Ganga flowing down from the snowclad peaks of the Himalaya. Kaushiki, the goddess of ethereal beauty, who has just emerged from Parvati, stands there exchanging a word with her, watched by the gods.
The most significant features of the painting are the far hillsides with wavy rims on pale edges, and the special type of female form with sensuous curves, tenderly rounded breasts, and dignified stance. The goddess has long black strands of hair, a rounded bun at the back, and serene demeanour. The stark bare background acts as a foil to her feminine grace.
The series of Markandeya Purana to which this painting belongs, is a noteworthy example of pre-Kangra art which can be ascribed safely to Guler. W G Archer dated the set to circa 1745.

Surpanakha Addressing Rama,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2009.89.jpg,"Surpanakha Addressing Rama
2009.89
DESCRIPTION
From an illustrated manuscript of Ramayana
The major hurdles in the life of Rama during his exile began with the episode of Surpanakha, the sister of Ravana, becoming enamoured of Rama. The episode is described in the Aranyakanda of the Ramayana (Chapter 5). Rama and Sita are seated on a platform under a tree while Lakshmana sits on a platform opposite. The tall demoness Surpanakha disguised as a beautiful lady is trying to convince Rama to leave Sita and take her instead as his wife. She tries to
win him with promises of comfort and luxury. She is adorned with various ornaments and stands before Rama respectfully, head covered with her odhani. Her gesture is indicative of her address to Rama.
The painting is more symbolic than realistic in its representation of the Ramayana. Usually the exiled group is shown clad in tribal or ascetic attire in the forest but here the artist has depicted them in fully royal dress. Moreover, clearly he has portrayed the demoness as a proportionately larger figure than the three protagonists. The separation of Lakshmana from Rama and Sita is also unusual. Thus either the artist was not familiar with usual Ramayana illustration or he was determined to give his own psychological interpretation of the episode.
Although the picture was rendered in the Deccan, its style differs from normal Deccani style and seems to follow the less flamboyant and flatter Rajput mode of expression, seen also in other series of paintings done for Hindu patrons. The simple, formal composition and the narrative strategy make this a fascinating work.

Rani Balauria,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2009.126.jpg,"Rani Balauria
2009.126
DESCRIPTION
Inscription in old Takri on the reverse: Sri Rani Valauri di Surati The likeness of the exalted Balauria Queen
In the portrait of Rani Balauria we have a miniature of quite unusual interest. The queen appears to be a young girl of about eighteen, and assuming she was twelve at the time of her marriage in 1759, the most likely date for the present
painting would be circa 1765. In any event, the painting cannot, on stylistic grounds, be assigned to a period later than the third quarter of the 18th century, and accordingly the inscription must refer to Amrit Pal’s queen. It should be noted that a
concession to the orthodox Basohli kalam has been made in the use of the broad red borders which surround the miniature. The background is uncoloured. The queen herself, however, is dressed in the Mughal manner, and affects the yellow and purple turban which was in vogue at the Imperial capitals amongst ladies of rank during the 18th century. Standard types seen in the painting were much favoured in Guler during Prakash Chand’s reign (1773–90).
The painting is unfinished, but the old Takri inscription thereon is obviously contemporary. It seems to have been a common practice to write inscriptions on paintings before they were completed. These inscriptions probably served the
purpose of an identification tag when the artists had several pictures in hand at the same time and were being aided by family members or pupils in their completion.

2009.12
DESCRIPTION
As Krishna grew up, he attended to the herds like any other village lad and, in the woodland where the cattle grazed, he and his companions played Blindman’s Buff or Hide and Seek or some other boyish game.
The headgear of the cowherds consists of a pointed cap (kulah) around which is tied a decorated sash (pechi) with loose ends. Krishna and his brother Balarama frequently wear this costume when tending the cows with their companions or while engaged in sport. When worn by Krishna and Balarama, the cap is surmounted with peacock feathers.
The delineation of a forest grove by a circle of trees occupies the main picture space. The dramatis personae are placed within this circle. There is marked stylization of tree forms. Among the two usual forms, the first is a tree which has the
appearance of a circular, many-petalled, dahlia. It has either a short thick trunk or a long narrow stem. The second form is an oval with the leaves drawn within the oval.

DESCRIPTION
REMINISCENT of the gigantic yaksha sculptures from Mathura and Bharhut, this yaksha was positioned as a dvarapala of a Buddhist cave temple, at Pitalkhora. As suggested by Dr. M.N. Deshpande, this yaksha may be yaksha Pitangalya refered to in the Mahamayuri. It was customary to identify these yakshas by the name of the place they resided in.
This dvarapala yaksha, guarding cave no. 3, belongs to the earliest phase of Pitalkhora caves which remained active almost till the 6th century CE. His robust figure carved in the round must have been installed at the railing entrance. He has large elephantine ears symbolic of his supernatural power. He is richly attired like his other contemporaries– cleverly tied turban with a crest knot in the centre, exposing the intricate design of the border of the turban cloth in the front. This adornment specifies the style of Indian ornamentation of that period. Voluminous spiral earrings in his left ear, are a variety of Vaprakundala worn by the other yaksha figures, such as yaksha Manibhadra from Mathura. Generally, the Vaprakundala has a square decorative plate for the base to be fixed to the earlobe, which is missing. In fact all the yaksha figures at Pitalkhora are adorned with the same kind of earrings. He wears a set of four thick bracelets on each of his forearms, and an armlet adorns his left

DESCRIPTION
THE Mahayana concept of the Bodhisattva was transformed into a visual form in the art of Gandhara, which has left a legacy of many beautiful large sculptures. Draped in princely attire and decked with rich ornaments, the haloed Bodhisattva is standing erect emitting a royal presence. He wears a girdled dhoti and his ample upavastra, neatly passes round his left shoulder twice, to hold it in place. The round bead pendant of his necklace is held by moulded deer-face motifs on either side almost in the shape of a rhyton which is fixed to a necklace of several rows of strings of tiny beads. It is interesting that though decoration of animal heads is often seen in Gandhara art, generally it is that of a lion or a crocodile. The Bodhisattva also wears a hasli and two other decorative strings, one passing round his left shoulder, and the other arranged like a yajnopavita which has several sacred drum shaped pendants. The Gandhara style is also evident in facial features, including the moustache, the urna and half-closed eyes in meditation, elaborate head-dress, and curly locks of hair falling on his shoulder

DESCRIPTION
From the shape and feature of their face and hairstyle and their expressiveness, this head likely represents bodhisattvas.
Numerous similar isolated stucco heads have survived from both Afghanistan and Pakistan and they are generally dated to the 4th–5th century. This head is one among the finest to have survived. The head looks frontally and there are some
losses on the face. The ears are without any ornaments. Nevertheless, it is a strongly modelled face with handsomely
proportioned features. While much of the hair is covered in encrustations, the projecting wavy hairline gives the face a greater sense of volume. The lips are particularly well shaped with the upper lip imitating the shape of a bow and the lower reflecting the soft sensuousness of Gupta period figures.

DESCRIPTION
Ceiling slab from Huchchappaiyya Gudi temple
THE three-faced and four-armed magnificent image of Brahma is seated on a lotus pedestal surrounded by an array of rishis, saints and devotees. The devotees, seated near his feet and the sages from the clouds above, are offering him flowers and other objects held in their hands. They all wear matted locks and beards and a scanty piece of cloth tied at the waist to cover them.
His mount, the swan also faces him with a raised beak as if joining the group in adoration of Brahma. The adoring figures rhythmically converge into the central figure of Brahma seated erect in perfect poise and serenity. His usual emblems akshamala, shruva and kamandalu are held by him in his three hands, whereas the fourth one is in the varadamudra. He is adorned with beautiful and intricately carved ornaments including the mrigacharma on his left shoulder. The treatment of clouds is particularly imaginative and the artist has succeeded in creating a sense of dimension even in this low relief.
The panel is bordered with a floral scroll similar to that of the image of Sheshashayi, indicating that these two were probably placed in the same row.

S 66.56
DESCRIPTION
THOUGH in the early period Kaumari appears as an individual goddess, she is assimilated with the Saptamatrika group– the group of seven goddeses– when it is standardised in the 3rd century CE. However, till the 6th century CE she continues to enjoy her position as an individual goddess as is evident from outstanding 6th century sculptures of Kaumari from Shamalaji and Parel. These mother goddesses were believed to be malevolent spirits who would inflict the children with diseases if they were annoyed. According to a legend narrated in the Vanaparvan of the Mahabharata, Skanda-Kartikeya converted these malevolent female spirits into benign mother goddesses.
Goddess Kaumari, in this image, is seated in a variation of Lalitasana holding a fruit in her right hand. One end of the long spear held in her left hand is supported on the ground. She wears a kuchabandha around her full breasts, while her lower garment is indicated by incised folds on the legs. Moderately bedecked, her ornaments consist of a beaded necklace, armlets and Chakrakundala. Her stylised coiffure shows her hair arranged in schematic locks tied with a chain ornament with a medallion fixed in the centre. Gupta characteristics are evident in her wide open eyes, thin upper lip and thick lower lip.

B 65.2
DESCRIPTION
THOUGH generally the position of the dvarapala or the guards is ascribed to men, Indian literature often refers to female guards known as yavanis. As mentioned in the Divyavadana and other later texts, female guards were employed by the kings. A.S. Altekar has referred to several examples of the female guards and stated that the Karnatak women were particularly known for this. The image was earlier identified as the chauri bearer by the scholars. However, the long club on which her hand is supported and her personality both suggest her role as a guard. The identification was confirmed by Anand Krishna in a personal discussion. Her top-heavy body is slightly stretched as she stands in attention, looking straight with her wide-open eyes. Her facial features, particularly the thick lips, and her bust are very different from the physical features of Indian women. It is possible that she is of foreign origin.

The images of Venugopala or Murlidhara have remained popular all over India. In this form Krishna is always shown with his legs crossed with one foot raised at an angle, and the arms swing in opposite direction holding a flute. This pose of Krishna is known as Tribhangamurari.
Here Krishna’s youthful figure is shown unadorned wearing only a short dhoti. He has pierced earlobes but no earrings. His hair is tied atop the head in a three-tiered bun. His wide open eyes and tilak mark on forehead are inlaid in silver. He is wearing typical pair of wooden sandals used by cowherds in villages even today.
This charming image of Venugopala is most probably from a domestic shrine where he would have been separately clothed and adorned, and accompanied by Radha.

DESCRIPTION
John Constable (1776–1837) was one of the finest English landscape painters of the 19th century in the Romantic tradition. He was born in 1776 to a wealthy mill owner in Suffolk, and against his family’s wishes, he was admitted to the Royal Academy in 1800. Throughout his life, he focused on painting the landscapes surrounding his home in East Bergholt. His renowned works include Wivenhoe Park, Dedham Vale, and The Hay Wain.
Constable had a rebellious approach to his art. He had a deep appreciation of the interplay of light and the ever-changing patterns of clouds. Rather than conforming to expected idealisations, he aimed for accurate representations of nature. He drew inspiration from the work of Thomas Gainsborough (1772–1788), another Suffolk resident, whom he greatly admired.
Constable’s dedication to capturing the essence of the natural world had a profound impact on the development of landscape painting. His attention to detail, and his ability to convey the effects of light and atmosphere, set him apart as an exceptional artist. His works captured the romantic beauty of the English countryside, resonating with viewers and inspiring future generations of artists.

A muddy track begins in the foreground between the two trees, veers to the right, and runs alongside a body of water. Along this track, there are human figures riding mules and carrying various goods. On the left side, a man can be seen fishing on the bank, while a reclining woman holds a basket. The artist has used delicate brushstrokes to capture the gentle warmth of the light, creating a soothing atmosphere.
Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788) was one of the most significant British painters during the latter half of the 18th century, and he was also one of the founding members of the Royal Academy of Arts.

DESCRIPTION
This painting is a near-close representation of the Carlo Borromeo Church in Antwerp. Constructed between 1615 and 1621, the church was designed by Peter Huyssens and Jesuit rector, Franciscus Augilonius. Previously titled Interior of the Austrian Emperor’s Palace, the painting may have been named so due to the prominent monument at its centre, resembling a shrine or altar. However, the partially opened door reveals columns and miniature sculptures within, suggesting it is a type of cabinet. The Kunst-kabinet (cabinet) in the painting is adorned with the Habsburg double eagle and crown. Such cabinets were popular among monarchs for showcasing their collections of exotic objects. On the right side, a park with Baroque garden sculptures can be seen.
Born in Germany, the artist, Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg, specialised in architectural paintings. Van Ehrenberg was likely a pupil of the architectural painter Dirck van Delen (1604/5–1671). Van Ehrenberg was the founder of the Antwerp School of Architectural Painting.

DESCRIPTION
John Constable (1776–1837) was one of the finest English landscape painters of the 19th century in the Romantic tradition. He was born in 1776 to a wealthy mill owner in Suffolk, and against his family’s wishes, he was admitted to the Royal Academy in 1800. Throughout his life, he focused on painting the landscapes surrounding his home in East Bergholt. His renowned works include Wivenhoe Park, Dedham Vale, and The Hay Wain.
Constable had a rebellious approach to his art. He had a deep appreciation of the interplay of light and the ever-changing patterns of clouds. Rather than conforming to expected idealisations, he aimed for accurate representations of nature. He drew inspiration from the work of Thomas Gainsborough (1772–1788), another Suffolk resident, whom he greatly admired.
Constable’s dedication to capturing the essence of the natural world had a profound impact on the development of landscape painting. His attention to detail, and his ability to convey the effects of light and atmosphere, set him apart as an exceptional artist. His works captured the romantic beauty of the English countryside, resonating with viewers and inspiring future generations of artists.

DESCRIPTION
Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata (1839 – 1904) was the founder of the Tata Group, one of the largest industrial conglomerates in India. At the time of his death in 1904, he left behind a legacy upon which the foundation of the Tata Group was built. It was one year after his passing that the foundation of this museum was laid. Years later, in 1922 and 1933, Jamsetji's sons, Sir Ratan Tata and Sir Dorabji N. Tata, generously bequeathed over 3,000 art objects to this museum.
In this portrait, Jamsetji is depicted wearing a Parsi prayer cap and a woven gray embroidered robe, seated comfortably in a cane chair. The use of bright light creates a high contrast, adding a dramatic effect to the portrait. He was 50 years old at the time this portrait was painted.
The artwork is signed and dated by the artist: ""Edwin Ward 1889.""
Edwin Ward, a British painter who was most prolific from 1833 to 1927, was elected to the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in 1891. Some of his works can be seen at the Castle Museum in Nottingham.

David and Abigail,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/David-Abigail.jpg,"David and Abigail
22.4561
DESCRIPTION
This scene is drawn from the Old Testament of the Bible, I Samuel 25. It depicts the wise and beautiful Abigail offering David a gift of copious goods, which her churlish husband Nabal had denied him, specifically the moments in verses 23 and 27: “And when Abigail saw David, she made haste, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David.… And [she said] now this present which thy servant hath brought, unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.” When Nabal learned of his wife’s furtive deed, “his heart died within him”, freeing her to marry David.
The artist of this large painting almost certainly is Erasmus Quellinus II (1607– 78), a well-educated Flemish painter and draughtsman who joined the artists’ guild in Antwerp in 1632.1 During the 1630s he was an important collaborator of Peter Paul Rubens, whose work had a profound influence on his own style. Following Rubens’ death in 1640, he became the official painter of Antwerp. Wealthy at the time of his death, he owned paintings by Rubens, Van Dyck, and other prominent artists, as well as many sculptures, prints, and drawings.
Like Quellinus II’s 'Reconciliation of Jacob and Esau and Jephta Greeted by his Daughter', which share many features with
David and Abigail, the Tata canvas probably was painted during the earlier 1630s. All three reflect the design and sumptuous staging of a 'David and Abigail' executed in Rubens’ studio a decade earlier (J. Paul Getty Museum). Quellinus II’s 'David and Abigail' in turn was the source of a later copy and a variant.

"Homer, Apollo and the Muses on Mt. Parnassus",https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/22.4535.jpg,"Homer, Apollo and the Muses on Mt. Parnassus
22.4535
DESCRIPTION
When auctioned at Christie’s in London in 1839, this painting was fittingly described as “Homer reciting his poems
before Apollo, who is playing the lyre; the Muses and Corybantes around him; Cupids with the car of Phoebus seen behind; in a circular frame; a beautiful composition, treated with true classical feeling”. A companion canvas depicted “Bacchus and Ariadne reclining on a bank, surrounded by satyrs and nymphs”. Both were consigned by Sir Henry Oxenden and were bought by George Yates. Bacchus and Ariadne are unidentified; the history of Homer, Apollo and the Muses between 1839 and Sir Ratan’s acquisition of it remains untraced.
What Christie’s had wrong, however, was the artist, whom they identified as the great French painter Nicolas Poussin (as
such it has remained in the Museum’s records). Homer, Apollo and the Muses are by Mattia Preti instead, a gifted artist from the south of Italy whose prolific career began in Rome (1630s–40s), flourished in Naples (1653–60), and concluded with a long sojourn on Malta (1661–99). That Poussin’s name could be attached to this painting points to its date around 1640 when Preti was moving away from a Caravaggesque phase to one that embraced neo-Venetian trends as exemplified in Poussin’s art. The low vantage point of Homer, Apollo and the Muses and its literary subject suggests that it could have decorated the ceiling of a library. No documents are known, however, that explain its origins.

Triumph of Bacchus Arriving on Naxos,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/22.4620.jpg,"Triumph of Bacchus Arriving on Naxos
22.4620
DESCRIPTION
Young Bacchus (Dionysus), the god of wine, rides a cheetah-drawn chariot surrounded by satyrs and maenads as he
arrives in Naxos, where he will rescue his bride-to-be, the abandoned Ariadne. The subject fits a set of five mythological
scenes celebrating wine and love, commissioned by Duke Alfonso d’Este to decorate a camerino in his castle in Ferrara.
Giovanni Bellini’s Feast of the Gods was completed first, by 1514, followed by three of Titian’s greatest secular works: the Worship of Venus, Bacchanal of the Andrians, and Bacchus and Ariadne. The group was completed by the local court artist, Dosso Dossi, with a scene described by the Renaissance historian Giorgio Vasari as “a Bacchanal rout of men which was so good, that, even if he had never done any other thing, for that alone [Dosso] would deserve praise and the name of an excellent painter”.
The Duke’s camerino is destroyed and Dosso’s Bacchanal unidentified – at least until 2000, when this painting, acquired by Sir Ratan shortly after it was sold in 1917 as “Dosso Dossi (School of)”, was put forward as the long-lost picture. It almost certainly is by the same hand as an altarpiece from the church of Santa Maria in Vado in Ferrara, which belongs to a group of paintings claimed to be Dosso’s early work. Most scholars, however, reject the claim on stylistic grounds. Moreover, to accept them would mean that the Tata painting, despite its apparently derivative correspondences with Titian’s Bacchus and Ariadne, pre-dates that masterpiece by nearly a decade. Thus it seems unlikely that this could be Dosso’s painting from the camerino.

The Sword of Damocles,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/22.4544.jpg,"The Sword of Damocles
22.4544
DESCRIPTION
When this painting was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1804, Dubost won the praise of Jacques-Louis David and a gold medal from Napoleon.It depicts the 4th century BCE tyrant Damocles surrounded by dancing girls and objects of luxury as he espies a sword precariously suspended above him, thereby realizing that with perpetual menace there can be no happiness. The dramatic, academic nude is fully Davidian, while its languorous pose, coyly veiled genitals, and attenuated leg partake in a fashion of the time to evoke androgyny.
Dubost took the painting to London where, in 1807, The Times declared it “one of the richest pictures we ever beheld”. It caught the attention of Thomas Hope, the Dutch-born merchant banker, collector, designer, and promoter of the Greek Revival. (Lawrence’s portrait, is of his younger brother.) He bought it for 800 guineas but infuriated Dubost by overpainting some areas and cutting the canvas down at the top in order to make it fit a symmetrical hang in his London town house. He even effaced the artist’s signature when Dubost’s detractors claimed that it was too good to have been painted by Dubost and must be by David instead. Dubost retaliated with a satirical painting of Beauty and the Beast, giving the beast Hope’s likeness. Hope’s brother-in-law slashed it to pieces, Dubost sued for damages, and he published a booklet exposing Hope as “more of the Dutch trader than the liberal patron.
Despite its quality and having been the focus of so much attention, by the time of the Hope auction in 1917. The Sword of Damocles had lost its attribution and sold for only £57-15-0 as “French School”. Recent cleaning removed Hope’s alterations and recovered the signature, inscribed in Greek in ancient form, “Dubost made it.”

Portrait of Henry Philip Hope,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/22.4614.jpg,"Portrait of Henry Philip Hope
22.4614
DESCRIPTION
England’s grand portrait tradition,extending from Van Dyck and Lely to Gainsborough and Reynolds, culminated in Thomas Lawrence. Despite patronage from Europe’s heads of state and the English aristocracy, and despite becoming President of the Royal Academy (1820), Lawrence was habitually in debt, chiefly because of his extravagant lifestyle, including the cost of amassing an unrivalled collection of Old Master prints and drawings. Pressed to produce (he was near bankruptcy in 1807), he took on more commissions than he and his assistants could complete. When Sir Ratan paid 525 guineas for this portrait at the Hope auction in 1917, he almost certainly was unaware that it had remained in Lawrence’s studio after the artist died, along with some 150 other unfinished portraits. It was only “abt 1/2 finished” and completed by another hand, perhaps that of the Irish painter Sir Martin Archer Shee.
Lawrence’s most dramatic full-length portraits have a low point of view silhouetting and enhancing their towering figures. Exemplary is his Portrait of John Philip Kemble, as Coriolanus (1798), which conceptually is akin to his Portrait of Henry Philip Hope.Henry Philip (1774–1839) was a younger brother of the more famous collector and taste-maker Thomas Hope , who in 1798 had been painted by William Beechey in Ottoman costume, turbaned and with dagger in hand. Henry Philip sat for Lawrence in 1805, likewise dressed in Ottoman style to evoke his travels and admiration of Greek civilization. His vast wealth included a sizeable collection of ancient sculpture, paintings, and gems. Among the latter was the world’s largest deep blue diamond, which still bears his name, the Hope diamond.

DESCRIPTION
Emil Rau, whose career awaits serious study, was born in Dresden in 1858; his death date is unknown. He attended the academy in Dresden and by 1879 entered the academy in Munich, where he settled and worked primarily as a genre painter, specializing in contemporary Bavarian subjects. Typical is his joyful and picturesque Test of Patience, which, like this example, is signed and dated 1888, the year before Rau reportedly was awarded a gold medal in London.
A published list of Rau’s principal works cites this painting with its German title, Am Scheidewege (Welt oder Kloster). It describes the story thus: “At the train station a peasant girl between two nuns at table with a young couple on their honeymoon trip”. The meaning is clear: the young girl is confronting the dilemma of deciding between a religious and a secular life. Rau and his audience undoubtedly saw a parallel between her modern quandary and the mythic choice of Hercules, who, at the crossroads, had to decide between an arduous life of virtue and the easy path of pleasure.

Adoration of the Magi,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/33.41.jpg,"Adoration of the Magi
33.41
DESCRIPTION
Born in Verona, Bonifazio worked primarily in Venice, where he absorbed the art of Giovanni Bellini and Giorgione, as well as that of his contemporaries Palma Giovane and especially Titian. In design and style his paintings are conservative, variations more than advances on models by the great Venetian masters. Although he ran a busy workshop (Jacopo Bassano studied under him), he seldom attracted high patronage or top fees. He and his collaborators spent some 20 years decorating the Palazzo dei Camerlenghi at the Rialto, all the while producing numerous private devotional and secular paintings.
Among those, the Adoration of the Magi was a particularly popular subject in the artist’s studio, where many versions with compositional variations were recycled. In the Tata painting, for instance, the pose of the central standing magus (who might contain a contemporary portrait) simply reverses his counterpart in Bonifazio’s Adoration at Petworth House; the turbaned magus at the right closely echoes a kindred figure in an Adoration of 1537 in the Gallerie dell’Accademia in Venice; and the posture of the Virgin in effect repeats her position in still two more Adorations in the same museum. All three of those paintings in the Accademia have been catalogued as studio productions, one of which is even dated 1558, three years after the artist’s death.

Bodhisattva Manjusri,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2009.610.jpg,"Bodhisattva Manjusri
2009.610
DESCRIPTION
Bodhisattva Manjusri is one of the most popular Buddhist deities in Nepal and is associated with the legend of origin of the Kathmandu valley. It is believed that originally the valley was a lake and it was Manjusri who cut a path with his sword
and created the Chaubar gorge in the south through which the water escaped to leave behind the verdant fertile land. His popularity can also be accounted for due to his role as the embodiment of wisdom and knowledge without which enlightenment is not possible.
In this metal image, he is represented as a princely youthful figure seated in the meditative posture known as vajraparyanka with feet placed on the thighs. He has four arms, two of the hands clearly holding the sword and the manuscript of the Prajnaparamita text. The other two would have held an arrow on the right and a bow on the left. While the sword symbolizes the cutting of the knots of ignorance, the book needs little explanation. The bow and arrow made of flowers are of course the attributes of the god of desire Kamadeva with whom Manjusri is identified. One of his synonyms is Vajrananga, Ananga being an epithet of Kama. In a number of descriptions Manjusri is said to display the flavour or mood of love (shringara rasa).
As Vajrananga he is imprecated in spells to bewitch women.
Likely here the bodhisattva is portrayed in the form known as Arapachana Manjusri since he presides over a group of five deities that originate from the five syllables a, ra, pa, cha, na. His popularity is evinced by the fact that the circa 12th century Sanskrit compendium of meditational visualizations (dhyana or sadhana) known as the Sadhanamala includes eight examples, though none describes him with four arms.

Bhaishajyaguru,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/33.743.jpg,"Bhaishajyaguru
33.743
DESCRIPTION
Buddha as the Lord of Medicine
The Buddha is seated in padmasana (lotus pose) holding a myrobalan in his right hand resting on his knee, while his left hand, which rests in his lap, supports a pot. He wears a samghati (upper garment) with a bold incised border over his left shoulder falling at the back in an unusual pattern. His elongated earlobes touch the shoulders. He has a prominent urna (tuft of hair between the eyebrows). His hair done in sharp curled ringlets rises into a three-tiered ushnisha (cranial protuberance) with a bud-shaped chintamani (wisdom jewel) above. His hair is secured with a headband with knots tied over the ears and tassels falling on both sides. His lotus seat is modeled only frontally; the rear was left plain for a possible inscription.
In Sanskrit, the term bhaishajya meaning healing, takes its root from bhishaj, to cure. In the Vedic mythology the celestial twins, Ashvinikumars, are the physicians of the gods. In Buddhism, aside from its physical aspect, healing also relates metaphorically to spiritual awakening. Bhaishajyaguru symbolizes Sakyamuni’s ability to heal the body as well as dispel the spirit of darkness. The concept is embodied in the Bhaishajyaguru Sutra which was first translated into Chinese by Srimitra around 317–322 CE, and later re-translated into Tibetan. The Sutra acknowledges seven Medicine Buddhas. However, in Tibet, Bhaishajyaguru with his own seven brothers is joined by Sakyamuni, making a group of nine. But they are rare as a group either in sculpture or painting in Tibet.
Basically, the image of Sakyamuni was modified by assigning the attribute of the myrobalan fruit, an important ingredient in Indian pharmacopia, to create images of the Healing Buddha. Further iconographic developments took place in Central Asia through which the cult of Bhaishajyaguru travelled to East Asia and Tibet.

DESCRIPTION
AS EVIDENT in this sculpture, the images from western Tibet belonging to the 11th–12th century bear clear influence of the art of Kashmir. King, Yeshe-O’ of Gugee in western Tibet, sent many Buddhist monks to study in Indian Buddhist universities. A well-known Buddhist monk Rinchen Sangpo (958–1055 CE) visited the university of Vikramashila on invitation from Atisa. When Rinchen Sangpo returned to Tibet he took with him several Kashmiri artists to work for the monasteries there. The artists worked together with the Tibetan craftsmen and created several monasteries, temples, sculptures and paintings, such as monasteries of Tobo, Tholing, Tsaparang and Alchi, to name a few. The Kashmiri artists left a definite influence on the art of Tibet giving rise to a new idiom, the combination of Tibetan and Kashmiri styles, during the 11th–12th century CE. The present image belongs to the same group or style.
Buddha is seated in bhumisparsha mudra.

DESCRIPTION
Sir Ratan Tata Art Collection
The scriptures of Prajnaparamita, goddess of transcendental wisdom, deposited by the Buddha in Nagaloka, are believed to have been salvaged by Nagarjuna in the 2nd century CE. This being before the time of the Dhyani Buddhas, Prajnaparamita, like Vasudhara, is not assigned to any one kula (family). It was much later that she was considered to emanate from all Dhyani Buddhas. However, Newar Buddhism which lays great stress on the worship of Triratna (the three jewels: Buddha, Dhamma, and Samgha) identifies these with the Adi Buddha, Prajnaparamita, and Avalokiteshvara respectively. Besides the Gunakarandavyuha, two other texts, Mahajjatakamala and Bhadrakalpanavadana, carry extensive passages on the worship of this Trinity, especially in Nepal.
Her lotus seat is equally finely chiselled with two rows of upper petals and a row of lower petals. To this is attached a trefoil arch aureole with a beaded inner border and flame tips along the outer edge. The three-line inscription on the pedestal reads:
“On the eighth day of the bright half of Shravana month of Nepal Samvat 815 [1695 CE] in the name of the mother
Manju, the group of four brothers led by Ranamuni commissioned this image in the name of their mother Manju.”

Hayagriva and Prajna are standing in an embrace with her left leg passing around his waist. The three-faced Hayagriva with six arms and four legs stands in Pratyalidha posture on two prostrate Nagas, holding a vajra, kapala, khadga, padma and an arrow. The sixth attribute is missing. His female counterpart holds the kapala and probably karttrika a cleaver. The three-faced god has three eyes each with a horse head on top, on the crown. He is clad with a tiger skin while his Prajna has a bone apron tied around her waist. Their faces are painted with gold and the horse-heads are painted in green. There is an inscription on the rear part of the pedestal which reads:
“These yuga-naddha image of the tutelary deity Dhyanagriva (Hayagriva) for the prosperity of the donor and his family and also for the attainment of the riches and Bodhihood, was caused to be made by Punyavardha at nPhigan (Dhigam ?).”

DESCRIPTION
FRAGMENT OF A YAB-YUM IMAGE
THOUGH highly mutilated the image is important for its provenance as this would be one of the very few authentic images from Tsaparang itself. The image was once a part of the Li Gotami collection who had copied the Tsaparang frescoes and presented some to this museum.
The clay sculptures formed an important part of the monasteries and temples of western Tibet and the Ladakh region during the 10th–13th century. Shilpashastras and Puranas consider clay as one of the suitable materials for making sculptures. The tradition was prevalent in India, Ceylon, Central Asia and China. For the bigger sculptures, wooden armatures were used. Then a thick coat of clay mixed with straw was applied. To get a smoother surface, layers of wool or fine straw were added. The finer surface was achieved by the final coat of very fine clay. The body was then given shape and ornamented. Finally it was given a coat of paint. The present image is made of fine clay with the straw filling inside.
The position of the image obviously indicates it to be a part of the Yab-Yum image, the male counterpart of which is now missing. Even though it is just a small remnant of the image, the face vibrates with the ecstasy of orgasmic bliss. The stylistic features, a particularly elongated torso, and the modelling of her long face bear the imprint of some of the characteristics of the art of Kashmir. It is no wonder, as Tsaparang was in close contact with Kashmir during this time, through the great master Padmasambhava or Rinchen Sangpo as discussed earlier. This image, broken at the shoulders and knees is adorned with the waist band of pearls, two pearl strings, and big round earrings, one of which is missing. Her bare body is covered with her straight hair let loose on her back. Her face is slightly titled up as in the Yab-Yum images with the prominent third eye and an open mouth exposing her teeth. Her eyes, eyebrows and hair are painted black while the body surface is glazed with red colour.

22.2914
DESCRIPTION
Bedecked in elaborate jewellery and crown, the bodhisattva sits in meditation pose on a lotus. The urna (tuft of hair between the eyebrows) is indicated by a circle on his forehead. His right hand holds a vajra or thunderbolt which he is about to hurl at evil-doers and the left hand exhibits the tarjanimudra or the gesture of admonition. Other than these two gestures of belligerence, he is portrayed as a gentle, elegant figure. The thunderbolt is the major clue to his identification as Vajrapani.
An inscription in Chinese characters on the upper surface of the lotus throne states, “Da Ming Yongle nian-shi”, meaning that the bronze was donated in the Yongle reign of the Great Ming period. Every feature of this image bears the characteristics of a group of bronzes that have now been firmly attributed to the reign of Ming Emperor Cheng Zu (1403–24) known to history as the Yongle emperor. This is particularly noticed in the two necklaces. The short one has two loops and a central medallion with three pendants. The longer one falls almost to his navel. The girdle which is tied round his dhoti has similar loops both in front and at the back. The two ends of the scarf draped around his shoulders are drawn forward loosely falling on his lap. Even the pedestal is noticeable for the treatment of the lotus petals with the tips slightly turned upwards; two strands of pearls run around the edges of the pedestal.
As the only one with an inscription of the Yongle period, this is not only the most important Buddhist bronze in the Tata Collection but it is also the only one of its kind in the Museum. Iconographically too, it is a rare image of Bodhisattva
Vajrapani.

DESCRIPTION
The deity, fully decked in heavy chainmail from neck to toe, including shoulder plates shaped as snake-hoods, sits on a recumbent roaring lion. His half-raised right hand must have held a spear which is now missing; the left hand resting on the thigh with palm upward holds a nakula (mongoose). His hair is tied in a bun, like a hermit’s, over which he wears a tiara with five leaves, the central lobe having a design of vishva-vajra (universal thunderbolt). His scarf with sharp folds spreads in a loop above his shoulders, behind his head, and under his armpits. His fierce countenance is emphasized by his bulging eyes, fangs, broad flat nose, moustache, and goatee.
This is in keeping with his role as one of the Eight Dharmapalas or guardians of the faith of Tibet. His mount, a white lion, has an armoured saddle and an angry countenance like his lord. Pigments have been used on his mane, inside the mouth, and on his tail to enhance the dramatic effect. Stylistically the bronze was likely made in eastern Tibet or China.
Vaishravana, the equivalent of Kubera, has a long history in Buddhism and the Buddhist art of India. He is depicted on a 1st-century Amaravati panel. Apart from his role as one of the Eight Dharmapalas in Tibet, he is one of the Four Protectors especially of the Gelugs Pa order, the other three being Palden Lhamo, Beg Tse, and Dorje Shukden. As one of the Four Maharajikas (Protectors) he is present at the Buddha’s birth in early Buddhist art. He is Commander of the Yakshas and the Lord of the North. His militant nature is evident from his attire, facial expression, and his aggressive mount.
Xuanzang, the Chinese pilgrim who visited India in 636 CE, refers to the temple of the Great Spirit King, i.e. Vaishravana, at Kapisa.

Vasudeva Kamalaja,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/78.36.jpg,"Vasudeva Kamalaja
78.36
DESCRIPTION
The concept of the ultimate oneness of all Existence manifested itself in the artistic imagery of Ardhanarishvara in the form of half Shiva and half Parvati. This is a state when all the opposites have dissolved into the Supreme Being. Such images of Vishnu and Lakshmi united into one body, are rarely found in India. It is possible that Vaishnavism, being a religion of devotion rather than tantra, did not particularly need this form for
their worship.
Except for a few examples from Kashmir, all the available representations of Composite Lakshminarayan or Ardhalakshmihari, are from Nepal where it is known as Vasudeva Kamalaja. The form gained popularity only in Kashmir and in the reign of the Malla dynasty in Nepal in the early medieval period. It is possible that this form was introduced in Nepal from Kashmir where the images of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti were popular. Shabdakalpadruma records a dhyana from the Tantrasara, of what may be named Ardhalakshmihari though quite unlike the dhyana of Vaikuntha Kamalaja (a composite form of Vaikuntha and Lakshmi), it does not describe the ayudhas of Lakshmi.

2009.601
DESCRIPTION
Vasudhara (literally stream of gems) is the Buddhist goddess of wealth and prosperity. Although she originated with Vajrayanists in India, Kathmandu valley is where she seems to have thrived. Newar (a designation of a particular ethnic group in the Kathmandu valley) Buddhists are avowed devotees of the goddess and dedicate such metal images or paintings during the performance of her special rite. They also prefer to represent her with six arms, rarely encountered in India. Aesthetically as well, the representations have a discrete quality that may be characterized as quintessentially Newar. The mellifluous contours, the resilient plasticity of the form, the svelte proportions, and the deft disposition of the graceful arms are some of the distinctive features of Newar aesthetic.
In this golden and gem-encrusted image she sits in the graceful lalitasana and is suitably crowned and bejewelled. An embodiment of physical charm and elegance, she displays with her six hands six attributes, four of which have to do with abundance and plenitude. These are the sheaf of gems (ratnamanjari) in the right middle hand, a fruit in the lower right which also extends in varadamudra, the sheaf of grain (dhanyamanjari) in the middle left hand, and the auspicious
waterpot in the lower left hand. The upper right displays a gesture that signifies the adoration of Tathagata (tathagata vandana) and the upper left grasps a manuscript symbolising knowledge. Thus, clearly she is imprecated for both material and intellectual benefits.

A Hindu Goddess,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/B-NT-7-Seated-Tata-with-a-Kapala-in-hand.jpg,"A Hindu Goddess
2009.604
DESCRIPTION
Several goddesses from Nepal, like this goddess are depicted seated in lalitasana with a small lotus supporting her extended right foot. A similar larger lotus would have served as her seat. She has four arms, two of which are in front of her torso. The right holds a kapala and the left displays the vyakhyana gesture. The attribute in the upper right hand is missing; but the corresponding left hand holds a lotus. On her forehead is clearly etched a vertical third eye. This together with the skullcup and the vyakhyanamudra clearly makes her a Hindu goddess, specifically a mother goddess or Matrika. This type of image, either seven or eight of which represent the group of mother goddesses, is as characteristically Nepali as is Vasudhara.
Unfortunately her upper right hand is empty which usually holds the discrete attribute that helps exact identification. In the Hindu context, the lotus is an emblem of Lakshmi or her spouse Vishnu. While Lakshmi is not generally regarded as a
Matrika, the probability is that this figure represents Vaishnavi, who is one of the group. The upper right hand then may have held a wheel.
Whatever the exact identification, this bronze remains a fine example of Newar aesthetic of the 14th century. Elegantly poised and proportioned with a beautiful face and chiselled features, the unknown goddess is an embodiment of ideal beauty and natural grace. Her slim rounded limbs are softly modelled and exude a restrained sensuality typical of the female form in Nepali sculpture. The facial features are sharp and delicate with a gentle expression and the ornaments are
exquisitely detailed.

55.58
DESCRIPTION
ASHTAMATRIKAS or a group of eight mothers are the female counterparts or shaktis of the corresponding gods. As stated in the Devi Mahatmya, the demon Mahisha had acquired a boon from Brahma that he could only be killed by a woman. He started terrorising the gods who requested Durga to come to their rescue and destroy the demon. All the gods transferred their own shaktis to Durga to strengthen her. These energies or shaktis were identified as emanations of the goddess Durga and could be reabsorbed into her body
at will.
The present image shows the deity seated in lalitasana. Her right foot is resting on a small lotus-shaped footrest. This four-armed goddess is holding a kapala, khadg and gada. Her natural left hand is in the abhaya mudra. The position of thumb and third finger suggests a rosary held in her hand.
She wears a dhoti with floral designs and leaf-patterned border. The upper garment covering her full breasts passes over the left shoulder and elegantly falls behind her. Represented as a young and slim woman of enchanting beauty, she wears a necklace, urahsutra, chakra-kundalas, armlet and anklets. Most of them are studded with semiprecious stones, showing a north-east Indian influence on the early Malla bronzes. She is wearing a three-pointed crown with fan-like side projections, generally seen in the Pala bronzes.
A very interesting feature of this bronze is the hairstyle. Her hair is tied into a big bun decorated with seven strings of pearls. This type of hairstyle is frequently shown in the art of Ajanta, Ellora and Aurangabad of the Vakataka and post-Vakataka phase.

Indra,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/22.1392.jpg,"Indra
22.1392
DESCRIPTION
The elegantly modelled god sits in maharajalilasana – the posture of royal ease. His left hand, holding the stalk of a lotus which rises above his shoulder, rests on his seat balancing the inclination of his body. On the bloom is the vajra or thunderbolt. His outstretched right hand, in gajahasta (elephant trunk gesture), rests on his raised right knee. The diminutive figure is richly ornamented with necklaces, yajnopavita (sacred thread), and a waistband with an interesting medallion clasp. The ornamental plates covering his legs look more like armour plates. A scarf, separately attached to the image, falls in a loop behind his neck and left hand. The lotus-petalled prabhavali (aureole) symbolizes his divine status.
Several features distinguish this Nepali image of Indra. One is the third eye placed horizontally across the forehead. Indra was cursed with having a thousand sores on his body which were later converted into eyes. Usually only one is shown in sculptures and it is delineated on the forehead like a normal eye, unlike the vertical third eye of Shiva. Second, the type of crown seen here is restricted to images of Indra and to Nepal – with antecedents in the art of Gandhara. Third, in Nepali images, Indra is generally seated in the pose of royal ease, which is appropriate for the king of the gods, but not encountered in India. Finally, he is the great wielder of the thunderbolt which is as old as the Vedic mythology.
Indra was one of the most important Vedic deities who destroyed the asuras, the demon enemies of the gods. He was also invoked for favours, including sending rains. In the later Hindu pantheon he was demoted to the position of guardian deity of the easterly direction (one of the ashtadikpalas); however he takes precedence in this group. His Vedic role as god of the rains continues to be remembered in Nepal where the annual festival of Indra – Indrayatra – is a national festival. It incorporates the more ancient Indo-European cosmic pillar cult.
In Buddhist mythology, Indra is credited with medicinal-healing qualities including as a remover of barrenness in women.

56.48
DESCRIPTION
The centre of the mandala is Vishnu as the para or the Supreme deity, painted white as described in the Panchratra Samhita. He is accompanied by his mount Garuda and consort Sridevi.
The mandala illustrates different aspects of Vishnu incorporated in the pantheon. The Panchratra concept of four vyuhas of Vishnu namely Vasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are depicted in the next circle. The ensuing circle shows eight figures holding a lotus who can be interpreted either as ashtanagas or eight vasus. The last or outermost circle depicts fourteen incarnations of Vishnu while the four corners are occupied by Vishnu, Ganapati, Mahakala and Devi. In the outer side of the square are rendered Navgrahas, Ashtadikpalas, Brahma, Bhairava, Indra, Kubera, Mahakala, Dvarapalas and other minor divinities.
The lower row at the top of the mandala illustrates multi-armed Vishnu flanked by twelve emanations or sub-vyuhas, while the upper row is occupied by the Dashavataras of Vishnu.
The inscriptions in the Newari script on the pata says that this Vishnu pata was meant to commemorate the event of Anantavrata by the king of Bhatgaon Sumatijayajitamitramalla. At the base of the painting, in the left corner, the king is seen performing the vrata in the presence of his priest and the family members, identified by the names written above their heads. The lower right corner of the pata shows some dignitaries of his court.
The king is known by the name Jitamitra Malla, who reigned for twenty one years. An ardent devotee of Vishnu, he is known to have built many monuments including a Dharamshala with the temples of Narayana in 1682 CE. Jagatprakash Malla, the father of Jayajitamitramalla, erected a Garuda pillar at Narayana Chowk.
The inscription at the spot says “Shri Jaya Jagatprakasha Malla Raja, the master of many arts and sciences, composed hymns in honour of Garuda-dhwaja for the benefit of the people…” This fact explains the unusual importance given to Garuda in this pata by depicting him six-armed. In the middle there is a dancing figure of Mahakala holding a flywhisk in both hands, flanked by musicians.
Anantavrata is a rite performed to propitiate Vishnu and is observed for fourteen years after which udyapana (literally dismantling the installation of the deity) is done. It is observed on the Ananta-Chaturdasi day, that is on the 14th day of the brighter half of Bhadrapada (August-September). According to a popular legend, Krishna suggested to the Pandavas to observe the wish-fulfilling Anantavrata during their period of exile to regain their power. The vrata gained popularity in Nepal during the last few centuries and such patas or paintings were consecrated at the time of udyapana of the vrata.

LEGENDS OF LOKESHVARA,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/55.63.jpg,"LEGENDS OF LOKESHVARA

DESCRIPTION
This particular scroll depicts the story of Red Machhendranatha popularly known as Bunga or the Lokeshvara in Nepal. According to the inscription on the scroll, it was donated by Shri Kashiraj Bharo of Byam Vihara, in the year 737 N.S.= 1617 CE on the occasion of the Rathayatra ceremony of Lokeshvara, the popular deity of Nepal. This festival of Rathayatra, celebrated in the month of April or early May, is attended by almost everybody with equal zeal and faith.
During the reign of King Narendradeva of Bhaktapur (740–777 CE), as the story relates, the valley of Kathmandu was experiencing the worst famine causing heavy loss of life for a period of over 12 years.
Gorakhanatha, with the intention of punishing the people for not giving him due respect and also with the thought that knowing people’s misery and sorrow, Machhendranatha, his Guru would appear in person, had imprisoned the valley’s rain-giving snake. Bandhudatta, the learned priest of the king started to fetch Lord Machhendranatha, youngest son of demon Shashi who ruled Assam. Because of the powerful recitation of the mantras, Machhendranatha transformed into a large black bee and flew into the golden ceremonial vase of Bandhudatta.
On the way back, they stopped near the river Nakhu, two miles south of Patan, to rest, where Gorakhanatha, who was residing on the top of the hillock, came to pay homage to his Guru, releasing the rain-giving gods. People rejoiced as it rained heavily. The sacred vessel was enshrined and a beautiful temple was then constructed in Patan. A mammoth festival was held in which the image of Macchendranatha was carried in a chariot around the streets of Patan. In keeping with the time-honoured tradition, the same practice is followed even today.
In the painting, the story runs from left to right. In the upper register, the king’s consultation with the spiritual guide Bandhudatta and the trial with the demons to bring Macchendranatha is shown. The second register depicts a hillock where Gorakhanatha used to reside, and the scenes related to the rescue of the rain-giving snake gods and the consecration of Machhendranatha in the temple. The third panel details the actual Rathayatra festival when Lokeshvara after being given a bath and performing other rituals, is placed inside the massive chariot. The donor is shown performing yajna in the presence of Vajracharya.
The scroll is a typical example of continuous narration. At some places, scenes are bifurcated with simple lines, architectural panels, or vegetations, and at others, various episodes run without putting any rigid partition, but by only suggesting it with the position of figures standing or sitting back to back. Each episode is set against the backdrop of a screen, decorated with floral and creeper designs. This is an early stylistic trait derived from the monastic style of painting. Draughtsmanship is bold but effective. The painting is done mainly in red, ochre and blue colours.

FOLIOS FROM AN ILLUSTRATED MANUSCRIPT OF DEVI MAHATMYA,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/56.45_1.jpg,"FOLIOS FROM AN ILLUSTRATED MANUSCRIPT OF DEVI MAHATMYA
56.45
DESCRIPTION
THE artistic traditions which migrated to Nepal from eastern India included the production of palm leaf manuscripts with illustrations painted on them. Even though palm leaf is not an indigenous product of Nepal, the tradition must have survived on imports most probably from India itself. However the painting style which evolved on their manuscripts remained typically Nepalese.
This manuscript, datable to c. 1400 CE is one of the earliest Devi Mahatmya illustrated manuscripts from Nepal. Devi Mahatmya, originally a part of the Markandeya Purana, was very popular in Nepal from where a number of illustrated manuscripts of the text have been found.
As referred to earlier, the text mainly describes the fight between the goddess Durga and Mahishasura and other demons who were destroyed by her. This Museum has in all 46 folios of the manuscript out of which eight are illustrated. The wooden covers of the manuscript are also illuminated on the outer sides. The folios are decorated with floral borders whereas the main illustrations correspond to the text and mostly depict Durga in different forms in combat with the demons. The illustrations cover almost all the important episodes from the myth.
These eight folios are :
1. Rishi Markandeya the main reciter of the Mahatmya, after whom this Purana is named, narrates the story to his disciple Kraushtuki Bhaguri. The ascetic is shown in his hoary form, whereas the disciple, with hands in the vitaraka mudra, is shown as a divine figure.
2. It relates to the first chapter of Devi Mahatmya where sage Medha narrates the Mahatmya of the great goddess Mahamaya to King Sumedha and Vaishya Samadhi.
3. Destruction of the Asuras Madhu and Kaitabha. Though there is a suggestive arched architectural band used as a base in other folios, the goddess here is shown standing on a river bed. The river is depicted with wavy patterns along with fish and molasses in their shells.
4. The goddess is killing the demon Mahishasura. This is a high point in the narrative of Devi and is most frequently depicted in art. As described in the text, the ten-armed Devi suppresses with all her strength, the demon emerging out of the body of Mahisha (buffalo), holding his tail by one hand. Her left foot is firmly placed on him while the right one is on her vehicle.
5. Kali, destroying Chanda and Munda in another folio.
6. Kali is killing the demon Raktabija. He is depicted twice here, once on the ground in blue colour, and secondly, when he was lifted up by Devi on her spear, shown in red colour.
7. The seventh folio depicts the killing of Shumbha.
8. Gods paying homage to the goddess.
The first two folios published here show ascetic Markandeya and Medha. The other three folios depict the killing of Chanda-Munda, Shumbha and visit of gods to Devi.
The two wooden covers are illustrated with the images of Shiva dancing on the bull, Mahishasuramardini, Kali, seven matrikas, Mahalakshmi and Ganesha.

A Lama,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/33.1063.jpg,"A Lama

DESCRIPTION
The thangka illustrates a grand lama of the Gelugpa sect identified by the conical yellow cap worn by him. He is seated in Padmasana on a decorated throne in the middle while the surrounding area narrates important episodes from his life. Seated straight in Padmasana, wearing a red sanghati made of 25 pieces of cloth with floral designs all over, he holds a pot containing the water of life in his left hand placed on his lap. Several ritual objects are placed in front of him on the table such as white chorten, symbol of the spread of Buddhism, incense burner, bell, scarf and a box.
Inscriptions identify the locations of the scenes around the lama. Right above him, in between the sun and moon, is the Tushita heaven, the seventh heaven and the final destination of the enlightened Buddhist souls. To its right, near the sun is the Copper Mountain Paradise and beyond it is Chamara Dvipa. To the left of the Tushita heaven are Sukhavati Paradise and Vajradakini Paradise. The remaining locations show monasteries and places of religious importance. These are, to the right of the lama: Khan sar gon (name of a place), Skyor mo lun Monastery, Drepung Monastery, a place of getting the ordination, Rinchen Hillock, Potala, Ramoche Cathedral (where the image from China came), Godang Khangsar (monastery) and right below the main lama is Jokhang. To his left are: Sera Monastery, White Rock Hermitage and Bde chen Monastery (This identification of places was done by Dr. Lokesh Chandra who read each inscription).
A very early style of depicting stories in mini composition is adopted here. Each episode is depicted in a small composition without any formal division, with the help of natural surroundings like clouds, open space, figural, natural and architectural forms and are rendered with minute details in subdued colours, giving it a rhythmic appearance.
Strong political and cultural relation of Tibet with China seems to have influenced the art of Tibet in many aspects, two of which are concerned with cloth painting. One is the tradition of representations of Arhat in the cloth painting introduced by a Chinese monk Lume and an Indian monk Atisa around 10th century CE and secondly, the introduction of landscape in the art of cloth painting which was basically figure-oriented. This tradition developed in Eastern Tibet perhaps in Karmapa monastery but by the end of the 16th century, the innovative Tibetan artists have developed a very distinct and interesting style of narration which owes very little to Chinese paintings. This painting belongs to the same group.

DESCRIPTION
Raula Vela: Poetry on Stone
Script: Nagari

The inscription narrates a poem about the raula vela (creeper of the royal household), composed by poet Rada, who describes the beauty, dress, and ornaments of the raula vela. The inscription is unique — linguistically and historically — and shows the great literary ability of the composer.
The poem talks of a marketplace where some men have brought with them good-looking and well-dressed girls from their regions, either for marriage or for sale. The scene may be that of a white slave market or a brothel. The text suggests the presence of seven men from seven different regions of the county. The presence of the first six is evident but due to damage to the text, that of the seventh person is not very clear. Each person speaks a different dialect.
This type of a poem is also called nakha-shikha (adorned from the toes to the tresses). In this kind of poetry, the glory, charms, beauty, and costume of the nayaka or nayika are described. The six sections it contains are written in six different dialects — Maithili, Marathi, western Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, and Malavi.

DESCRIPTION
SAMBANDAR, a child of the brahmin caste and a Shaivite devotee was born at Sirkazhi near Chidambaram in the 7th century CE. He is second of the Natvars and one of the sixty-three Nayanmars. He is generally represented as standing or dancing.
Here, Sambandar is standing on a circular lotus pedestal resting on a bhadrapitha. His right leg is slightly bent and his left leg is straight. The index finger of his right-hand points upward towards heaven where Parvati resides and his left-hand holds the cup of blessed milk offered by Parvati when he was hungry and crying. It is narrated that once when he was still a small child, his father took him to a temple, left him to play in its courtyard and went for quick ablutions. In the meantime, young Sambandar felt hungry and started crying for milk when Parvati herself came to feed the young saint. On his return, the father inquired as to who had fed him. The child promptly pointed his finger upwards towards the heavens where the gods are supposed to dwell. The episode is also referred to by Shankaracharya in Saundarya Lahari.
Sometimes Sambandar images are shown holding cymbals in both hands when he sang in praise of Shiva and Parvati. His hair is done in curls. The ears are elongated and pierced. He is adorned with two ekavalis, bracelets and anklets and a girdle of bells around his waist, with a dagger attached at the back.

DESCRIPTION
Tanchoi, symbolic of the heyday of the Parsi community of the 19th century CE, developed as an Indo-Chinese textile along with the gara. The first Baronet Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, sent three weavers from the Joshi family of Surat to the master weaver Chhoi in Shanghai, to learn the art of Chinese silk weaving of a particular kind, around 1856 CE. When they returned after acquiring a considerable command over this art, they bore the name of their master ‘Chhoi’. The material woven by them was called ‘Tanchoi’, meaning the material made by the three (tan) chhois. Tanchoi sari was so popular with the Parsis that practically every home possessed at least one. It also occupied its place in the marriage trousseau of the Parsi bride. The basic technique of Tanchoi is the ‘twill’ weave, and ‘sateen’ weave which can produce an unbroken surface of colour while retaining sufficient strength in the structure. Coloured warps and wefts produce elaborate designs in polychrome. Instead of alternate threads of warp and weft weaving in the plain cloth, in ‘twill’ and ‘sateen’ the interval is increased. The ‘twill’ weaving which produces a much closer fabric than the plain satin weave, was employed specially for the pallus. The rest of the sari was woven by ‘sateen’ weaves. The patterns, particularly of the ground of the sari, or of the plain material, are arranged in diagonal formations such as the lozenges, and most complex designs are formed by variations of the same. Proper balance between the thickness of the warp and the weft, correct calculation of the number of picks required for the design and accurate blow of the comb to compact the weft while weaving and the quality of the raw material determine the perfection of the final product. The most important test of the Tanchoi is the complete absence of loose long floats on the other side of the fabric, even if they are required at long intervals in the pattern.Even in the most intricate designs, such floats are not permissible in Tanchoi weaving. With the introduction of power loom and change in fashion tanchoi weaving went out of vogue in the early 20th century.

This Zabla has cheena-cheeni (chinese figures) and, flora and fauna designs embroidered on it.
Parsi zablas are loose, collarless, knee length blouses worn with loose izars (pantaloons) by Parsi children. Originally the zabla was made of a single piece of silk, satin or cotton. After the commencement of China trade in the 18th century, richly embroidered garo (sari) pieces were also used for stitching zablas.
The birth of a child brings great joy as it ensures the growth of the family tree. His arrival in civilised society is marked with a gift of a soft mulmul zabla. According to Indian tradition, it is considered inauspicious to buy any new clothes for the new born. In fact at first the baby is made to wear old clothes of a child from the family. The used clothing is soft for the tender baby skin and it is believed that through these clothes the positive family vibes and values would pass onto the baby. The arrival of a baby is remembered by its tiny clothes; a marriage ceremony by the carefully wrapped up wedding attire; parents are remembered through the garments they pass on to their children. This is perhaps one of the reasons why we treasure heirlooms. The tiny dresses worn by our children hold sweet memories. Treasured more than any expensive garment, they are a strong symbol of love. Earlier, they were stitched and embellished by mothers, aunts, and grandmothers for the child but today the trend of such home-stitched garments is on the decline, being replaced by the variety of readymade clothing available in the market.
Gifted by daughters Prochi Shroff & Behroze Bilimoria in memory of Mehroo & Jamshed Billimoria.

83.4/3
DESCRIPTION
Tanchoi, symbolic of the heyday of the Parsi community of the 19th century CE, developed as an Indo-Chinese textile along with the gara. The first Baronet Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, sent three weavers from the Joshi family of Surat to the master weaver Chhoi in Shanghai, to learn the art of Chinese silk weaving of a particular kind, around 1856 CE. When they returned after acquiring a considerable command over this art, they bore the name of their master ‘Chhoi’. The material woven by them was called ‘Tanchoi’, meaning the material made by the three (tan) chhois. Tanchoi sari was so popular with the Parsis that practically every home possessed at least one. It also occupied its place in the marriage trousseau of the Parsi bride. The basic technique of Tanchoi is the ‘twill’ weave, and ‘sateen’ weave which can produce an unbroken surface of colour while retaining sufficient strength in the structure. Coloured warps and wefts produce elaborate designs in polychrome. Instead of alternate threads of warp and weft weaving in the plain cloth, in ‘twill’ and ‘sateen’ the interval is increased. The ‘twill’ weaving which produces a much closer fabric than the plain satin weave, was employed specially for the pallus. The rest of the sari was woven by ‘sateen’ weaves. The patterns, particularly of the ground of the sari, or of the plain material, are arranged in diagonal formations such as the lozenges, and most complex designs are formed by variations of the same. Proper balance between the thickness of the warp and the weft, correct calculation of the number of picks required for the design and accurate blow of the comb to compact the weft while weaving and the quality of the raw material determine the perfection of the final product. The most important test of the Tanchoi is the complete absence of loose long floats on the other side of the fabric, even if they are required at long intervals in the pattern.Even in the most intricate designs, such floats are not permissible in Tanchoi weaving. With the introduction of power loom and change in fashion tanchoi weaving went out of vogue in the early 20th century.

The Tanchoi sari was highly significant in the Parsi community during the 19th century, as it was developed as an Indo-Chinese textile and became popular among Parsis. Practically every home possessed at least one Tanchoi sari, and it was a part of the marriage trousseau of Parsi brides.
Can you explain the basic technique used in making Tanchoi saris?
The basic technique of Tanchoi involves the 'twill' weave and 'sateen' weave, which produce an unbroken surface of color while retaining sufficient strength in the structure. Colored warps and wefts are used to create elaborate polychrome designs.
What distinguishes Tanchoi weaving from other weaving techniques?
Tanchoi weaving employs a combination of twill and sateen weaves, arranged in diagonal formations such as lozenges. The most complex designs are formed by variations of these formations.
How did Tanchoi weaving decline in popularity?
Tanchoi weaving went out of vogue in the early 20th century due to the introduction of power looms and changes in fashion trends.
What factors determine the perfection of the final Tanchoi product?
The perfection of the final Tanchoi product depends on factors such as the balance between the thickness of the warp and weft, the accurate calculation of the number of picks required for the design, and the quality of the raw material. Additionally, the absence of loose long floats on the other side of the fabric is crucial, even in intricate designs.
Who initiated the development of Tanchoi weaving, and what was the significance of the name 'Tanchoi'?

Ghaghrapat – Skirt Cloth,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/22.3181_01.jpg,"Ghaghrapat – Skirt Cloth
22.3140
DESCRIPTION
The red gaji silk (satin silk) skirt cloth or ghaghrapat is embroidered with alternating rows of floral butas and peacocks. There is a floral scroll border. Between the last row of butas and the border is a row of alternating peacocks and putlis (dancing women). Each figure is flanked by a pair of parrots.
This ghaghrapat was probably made by the professional embroiderers of the mochi community. Cobblers by profession, the mochi community had in the distant past begun embroidering leather. The embroidery was done in chain stitch with the help of an ara or awl. The same technique was applied to finer material – silk – with a finer awl called the ari, resulting in fascinatingly intricate chain stitch.
The main motif is usually a buta. In this ghaghrapat the buta is in the form of a flowering shrub with six flowers. The designs were block-printed on to the cloth before the embroidery was begun; thus the butas are uniform throughout except for a strip at the top that has been stitched to the main field. There is a row of blockprinted peacocks untouched by thread at the top of the main field.
This piece shows similarity with the ghaghras in the collection of the Calico Museum, Ahmedabad.

DESCRIPTION
A rumal is a large square or rectangular piece of muslin or khaddar, embroidered with brilliant colours, which were generally used as covers for offerings to deities or gifts exchanged at weddings and festive occasions. Many miniature paintings depict women going to the temple carrying offering trays covered with such rumals. Sometimes, rumals are also used as pichhavais in temples. These were embroidered by women, including those of the royal household, during their spare time.
The Chamba rumals are distinguishable not only by their technique of embroidery but more so by their complicated designs, incorporating several human figures. The subject matter of these embroideries was mainly epic stories, legends of the Devi, Radha-Krishna, shikaar scenes as well as life in court.
This rumal depicts a king enjoying a music party. The pattern outlines were drawn on the surface with fine charcoal. In palaces and royal houses, the work was entrusted to the painters of the atelier — leaving a remarkable influence of the Pahari miniature painting on the Chamba-embroidered rumals. The outlines of patterns were then filled with black silk thread in stem stitches. After this, untwisted silk threads in bright colours were used in satin stitches.

DESCRIPTION
Indian textiles were exported to Egypt in Roman times, although the trade may be much older. Hundreds of fragments of textiles were discovered in Fustat, near Cairo, Egypt. Research revealed that they were made in Gujarat, in western India. Most of these block-printed textiles reached Egypt between the 11th and 16th centuries when trade across the Indian Ocean was dominated by Arabs and Indians.
The blue in these textiles came from the indigo plants, while madder was used to create different shades of red, from pink to brown. A close study of similar fabric fragments suggests that they were used both for furnishing and clothing. The motifs can be related to patterns in Jain manuscript paintings as well as the decoration of Islamic buildings in Gujarat.

Rumal – Square Shawl,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/22.3133_01.jpg,"Rumal – Square Shawl
22.3133
DESCRIPTION
The rumal, literally a “handkerchief”, is a large square designed primarily for women’s wear. Well-to-do women from Iran to Egypt wore it folded diagonally round the waist or shoulders, or draped over the head as a veil. Rumals were also popular on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the fashion being to wrap one around the shoulders and across the front of a woman’s low-cut dress.
Rumals were primarily kani shawls skillfully put together from many pieces by the rafugar (needle worker) whose expertise was such that their seams were all but invisible. These assembled patchwork shawls were generally defined by large butas that often occupied most of the space. Towards the latter half of the 19th century, the motifs became so large as to cover the entire expanse, as seen in the shawl shown here. The white octagonal centre is surrounded by elongated butas stretching the length from the ends towards the centre, in deep reds, purples, and greens. The butas are filled with small flowers; larger ones appear in the border. Circumscribing the kani-worked piece is a fringe that has small squares or gates of plain twill pashmina in orange, red, black, white, and green.

Shawl with a Figurative Design,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/22.3130_01.jpg,"Shawl with a Figurative Design
22.3130
DESCRIPTION
The shawl consists of a plain light yellow field with equal borders along the sides making it a rumal (square shawl). The borders, woven in a figurative design, have been recycled from a Kashmir kani pashmina shawl. A shawl-maker has taken the border, split it lengthwise, and stitched it on to the yellow fabric, making the upper part the end borders and the lower part the side borders. The figurative design includes women wearing what could be a short sari; some women have a basket attached around their waist. The male figures are dressed in fitted pants and a short top; some also appear to be holding an elongated container. Birds, elephants, tigers, and cheetahs can also be seen.
The first known figurative shawls date from the late 18th century and after. But it is hard to imagine what the actual piece must have looked like with so little surviving. Were there figures all over the shawl or only on the borders? Figurative shawls were not usually intended as garments to be worn, but were used as floor-spreads, hangings, or coverings of various sorts. They were usually embroidered, as this allowed a more minute delineation of features, but a few made (like the one shown here) using the twill-tapestry method are known. Figurative designs usually included shikargah (hunting) scenes or other figurative elements, often incorporated into the usual buta repeat format, of which the shawl here is an example. The figures shown here have a distinctively “folk” feel about them; they may be influenced by the embroidery of the neighbouring hillstates.

In both the cloths, the dark blue ground has circular medallions at the centre surrounded with intricate embroidery. The borders are profusely worked and have elongated cones/quiris (paisley motifs) and floral designs, with floral and mihrab (arched window) designs along the edges.
As compared to woven design, embroidery offered more freedom to the craftsman in embellishing plain woven fabric. Such embroidery was usually worked on plain alwan woollen cloth, creating embroidered shawls. The term amlikar was applied to shawls that were embroidered rather than having designs woven into them.Being of finely woven cotton, these are not shawls but may have been used as bedcovers. They are lined with thick cloth and are quilted.

DESCRIPTION
The delicacy and charm of a Kashmir shawl reflected the creativity of the designer and the wide palette of colours he worked with. This ranged from bright and vibrant shades in the early 18th century to more muted tones by the middle of the same century. The shawl shown here is woven in subdued shades of blue, green, and red on a cream background.
The multi-floral buta (paisley) motifs in the pallav (end panels) are finely delineated with their elegantly curving tips. After leaving an outline of the base fabric, the space between is filled with small flowers meandering off a vine. A narrow border, with blooming flowers and curving leaves, runs all the way around the shawl and separates the pallav from the field. The field is covered with smaller butas facing alternate directions, and changing orientation at mid-point so that the shawl hangs correctly at both ends. These smaller butas are also worked from a multi-floral pattern; around them scrolls the same floral pattern as in the pallav. The use of one element repeated in an all-over design on the shawl accentuates the use of the motif but also adds to the rather symmetrical charm of the piece.

DESCRIPTION
By the mid-19th century in Kashmir the embroiderer’s art had reached its zenith. Here, fine embroidery is known by the Farsi word suzani, which is a generic term for embroidery. Suzani which has developed an extensive and diverse design repertoire that utilizes a variety of stitches including darning and double-darning stitches, running, buttonhole, stem, satin, herringbone, knot, and couching. There are two features that set Kashmiri embroidery apart from other embroidery traditions – one is the imitation kani stitch, a stem stitch reinforced by a very fine couching stitch; this is known as the suzani stitch. The other is the use of scissors to cut the loose threads from the back of the fabric so that there are no floats visible on the reverse.
For most embroidered shawls the designs are block-printed onto the fabric using intricately carved walnut-wood blocks. The embroidery on this shawl is worked on a cream background in deep shades of red, pink, blue, yellow, green, and brown. The pallav is very narrow and the entire body of the shawl is worked with scrolling vines that meander diagonally across the surface from which emerge small butas, flowering plants, and leaves.

DESCRIPTION
This almost complete figure was also once polychromed but most of the pigments are now lost. Wearing a dhoti and a shawl, a torque around the neck, and part of an armlet still attached to his right arm, the figure genuflects on his right knee. Unfortunately, both his hands are broken but likely they held an offering. The figure must once have formed part of a more elaborate tableau with a central image of Shakyamuni.
What is clear from the face is that he represents a young boy rather than an adult. The smiling countenance has a beatific expression and he may portray an angelic worshipper rather than a human one. The round, cherubic face is framed with curling locks on three sides and crowning the head is a small topknot. The closest stylistic parallel is the detached head of another boy probably from Hadda in a private collection in Japan. There is a likelihood that this charming kneeling angel is also from Afghanistan, if not Hadda. However, one cannot rule out the possibility of Taxila in Pakistan being a possible source.
Whatever the exact place of origin, the sculpture clearly shows the unknown sculptor’s mastery of modelling in stucco. Like stone, stucco was a popular medium in Gandhara from at least the 1st century though along with clay it became more popular in the 4th–5th century when this engaging and angelic devotee was created. It is admirable for the subtle plasticity of the form as well as its gentle expression.

TC 76
DESCRIPTION
The final ordeal of the Buddha before achieving Enlightenment was an attack by Mara, the temptress who attempted to arouse his passions and attacked him along with her grotesque warriors. The assault of Mara was a favourite theme of the artists illustrating the life of the Buddha in stone. The Buddhacharita of Ashvaghosha meticulously describes the appearance of these soldiers or the putras of Mara who assaulted the Buddha, some of them having three faces and long ears like those of an elephant.
The terracotta depicts one such creature having two faces, expressing two different emotions. The face on the left side with fully stretched lips and cheeks is supposedly jeering at the Buddha, whereas the other one is fierce with a wide open mouth exposing a full row of teeth. Big round eyeballs of both these faces bulge out of their eye sockets. Their ears carved high up on the temple, combine to form a circle between neatly arranged tassels of hair, while their whiskers protrude from the joint of their faces. High cheekbones, straight nose and front hair arranged in curled tassels reveal Gandhara affinity in this masterly crafted face.
Similar faces were depicted earlier in stone for instance, on the rear view of the central lintel of the north gate at Sanchi. The style continued even in the Gandhara period as is seen in the panel depicting Mara’s army in the Lahore Museum.

DESCRIPTION
A number of ivory triptychs of the Buddha have come to light from Kashmir, most of which belong to the 8th–9th century. A growing need for personal rituals and portable shrines could have inspired the creation of such triptychs in different materials.
During the 7th–8th centuries, particularly under the rule of King Lalitaditya (c. 699–735 CE), Kashmir flourished as an important centre of art. Exposed to various currents of artistic expressions, through the brisk movements of the surrounding kingdoms in their power game, Kashmir emerged as a confluence of cultures and developed a distinctive Kashmiri art style. This triptych is one of the early examples of this style.
The ivory faithfully illustrates the scene of the miracle on mount Gridhrakuta narrated in the Saddharma Pundarika. The text gives a picturesque description of the event, “Then did those who were assembled and sitting together in that congregation, monks, nuns, male and female lay devotees, gods, nagas, goblins, Gandharvas and demons, Garudas, kinnaras, the great serpent, men and beings not human, as well as governors of a region, rulers of armies and rulers of four continents, all of them with their followers, gaze on the Lord in astonishment, in amazement, in ecstasy. And at that moment there issued a ray from within the circle of hair between the eyebrows of the Lord.”
The image represents a very interesting and meticulous account of the event. Buddha carved in deep relief is seated in Padmasana under a tri-foiled arched cave resting on gadrooned pillars. The sanghati covering his shoulders ends in beautiful pleats spreading over his knees. Typical of Kashmiri images of this period, the folds of the sanghati look like an open collar around the neck. The antarvastra or a tight-fitting garment underneath the sanghati covering his legs is clearly visible. His hair is tied in a bun and an urna is prominently marked on his forehead. His half-closed fish-shaped eyes, the pointed nose which is slightly broken now, and bow-shaped smiling lips are rendered in a style peculiar to this period in Kashmir. The throne bears figures of antelopes and a pair of lions below.
He is flanked on either side by six pairs of identical figures. These figures include two yakshas, two royal figures seated with folded hands and head bent down in adoration of the Buddha. The figures of the Gandharvas, two of whom are holding a flower or pearl trays, as well as the devotees, are seen peeping out of small spaces in between, eager to witness the miracle. Amazed by this sight, the two ascetics seated on top wearing matted locks on their head, have their eyes closed in deep ecstasy and express wonder with the gesture of their hand.
Two exquisite royal figures, though separately carved, belong to the same group and are placed as devotees on either side of the Buddha, standing elegantly facing him in a slight profile. The highly stylised posture of their hands is probably the depiction of the tantric form of a variant of namaskara mudra. As described by Geshe Kelsang Gyasto in his book Tantric Grounds and Paths, “to do this (special mudra) we place our palms together in the mudra of prostration but leave the fingertips slightly apart, like the petals of a lotus flower starting to open, and tuck our thumbs inside to symbolise a precious jewel hidden within the lotus.” Each king is also attended by a person with a tray full of flowers or pearls, a chauri bearer and another attendant.
The treatment of the siddhas is realistic. It is an imagistic narration where, in a limited given space encircling the main image, the artist has tried to depict the entire episode without following any sequence of events, just concentrating on the expression of the superhuman power of the Buddha. Each figure is carved with amazing minuteness, painstakingly avoiding any monotony. The images are partially painted.

DESCRIPTION
Originally belonging to Bihar, this image, along with two Bodhisattvas, was discovered from the campus of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, about 25 km north-east of the Museum. Considerable Buddhist activities are evident in the vicinity, particularly at Kanheri caves where strong eastern Indian influence is discernible during this period. This is also confirmed by an inscriptional dated 844 CE which indicates that there was close interaction between Bengal and Western India.
Tara, also known as the goddess of mercy, is the most popular Buddhist goddess. She is the consort of Avalokiteshvara. In her simplest form, Tara carries the night (blue) lotus in her left hand and her right hand is in the varada mudra.
The goddess here is seated in Lalitasana with her right leg pendant resting on a lotus. Her left leg is folded on the Simhasana. Her right hand is in the varada mudra, and her left hand is now missing. She wears various ornaments and an elaborate coiffure. A transparent odhani passes across her breasts and is gathered in thick folds at the back. The pitha on which she is seated is spread with a beautifully patterned textile as noticed on the right side. The image was probably gilded and the eyes and the tilaka mark are inlaid with silver. There is an inscription on the pedestal behind.

B 67.5
DESCRIPTION
The worship of Avalokiteshvara amongst the Buddhists of the Mahayana sect became quite popular from the early 5th–6th century CE. Fa Hien has recorded that the Mahayanists in Mathura were in the habit of presenting offerings to the Prajnaparamita, to Manjushri and to Avalokiteshvara. He also mentions that the miraculous statues of this most popular and helpful Bodhisattva were found in large numbers in Kashmir.
The image displays influences from various quarters including Central Asia, Bengal, Tun-Huang images from China but has a distinct style of its own. The bodhisattva is standing on a lotus pedestal, holding a lotus flower with a long stem in his left hand. His right hand is in the varada mudra offering blessings to the devotees. His three-peaked tiara distinctly shows an image of the Dhyani Buddha as enjoined by the Sadhana-mala. He is wearing a prominent flower garment reaching right up to the ankles as is generally seen. He is decked with several ornaments such as the karna-phool, anklets, flowers tucked on top of the ears and necklaces. The mrigacharma tied in a reef knot in front of his chest covers his entire right shoulder. The ends of his dhoti reaching up to his knees are arranged between his legs in a chevron pattern. The curls of his hair fall down on his shoulders. The pedestal had an opening on the rear probably to keep the shasha as was customary with the Vajrayana Buddhists.

DESCRIPTION
In 1906, even before the building was constructed, the museum acquired its first object – a plaster cast head of Buddha made by John Lockwood Kipling. John Lockwood Kipling was a British artist who spent most of his working life in India. In 1865, he was appointed as a professor in the J. J. School of Arts, Bombay (now Mumbai), and later became its principal. During 1870–1872, Kipling was commissioned by the government to tour the North-west Frontier (Punjab) and Kashmir to make a series of sketches and paintings of Indian craftsmen as well as various sites and antiquities in these regions. The present plaster cast was perhaps done by Kipling during this tour.

DESCRIPTION
The rising hood of a serpent indicates that this once belonged to an impressive image of a serpent goddess, known generically by the Sanskrit expression nagini. The head was purportedly found in Besnagar (also known as Bhilsa), an ancient urban site in today’s Madhya Pradesh. Besnagar lies in what used to be the heartland of the Gupta empire. The head also typically exemplifies the aesthetic of the Gupta period, with strongly modelled and sharply chiselled features.
The oval face is dominated by large half-open eyes, a noble nose, and a sensuous mouth with a full, fleshy underlip. The hair is rendered typically in ringed, spring-like coils, sitting on the head like a wig with a crest on top. The snake hood’s volume is indicated by parallel curving lines, ending in a head with glaring, expressive eyes and a gem on top.
The veneration of serpent deities appears to have continued well into the Gupta period as is clear from several impressive surviving examples that were housed in structural shrines.

KING SALA FIGHTING LION,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2.jpg,"KING SALA FIGHTING LION
S 85
DESCRIPTION
From the temple of Tripurantaka
The image which was originally a part of the Tripurantaka temple built in 1070 CE visualises in stone the famous legend of the Hoysala King after whom the dynasty derived its name. The Hassan inscription dated 1149 CE, is the earliest inscriptional record of the legend, describing the event in detail.
There are several versions of the incident which occurred at Sosavur (also known as Angadi) in the Kadur district in Karnataka. As cited in Gadag Inscription of Viba, Ballala II dated Saka Samvat 1114= 1192 CE, Sala was passing through the forest. An ascetic, terrified at the appearance of a lion called out hoysala (strike Sala) hearing which he slew the lion. Another version recorded in the Belur inscription 171, states, that when Sala was hunting along the slopes of the Sahya mountains of the Western ghats, he was astonished to see a hare pursuing a lion. Terrified of the lion the rishi called out poysala (strike Sala) and before it could step a span, Sala slew it with a dagger. This gave the Hoysalas their family name and their crest. Other versions describe Sala killing the lion with a rod of a cane or an iron.
The sculpture highlights the slaying of the lion by placing the King and the lion in the foreground. The might of the pouncing lion is vividly expressed by the amplification of his figure in proportion to the entire stele as also by highly stylised fierce claws, bulging eyes and wide open mouth. The King is fast advancing towards him in big strides with a raised straight and broad sword in his right hand, and a shield in his left. Two small boars near the king’s leg and an elephant is seen behind the lion, profuse flora with trees and winding creepers all around on the sides and the top of the slab, suggest the forest.
The artist has depicted the earlier sequence of the King hunting in the forest by carving a smaller figure of the King on a richly caparisoned galloping horse behind, at a distance. The hunting dogs wearing collars around their necks are trying to attack the lion.
The ascetic, who was frightened by the animal, witnesses this feat of the king sitting on the branch of a tree in the right corner. His hair is tied straight behind in a bun and a short dhoti is the only garment covering his otherwise bare body. The king is adorned with various ornaments and a wig-like head-dress with peacock feathers carved in the centre. His pose is typical of many viragal heroes from Karnataka. The sculpture beautifully reveals how the quality of stone has facilitated the rhythmic flow of lines of the intricate design work as well as deep and smooth undercuts.

A Meditating Jina with Two Attendant Deities,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2009.638.jpg,"A Meditating Jina with Two Attendant Deities
2009.638
DESCRIPTION
Jina, literally meaning the conqueror, is the title of an enlightened being who is freed from the chain of rebirth.
When it came to representing the 24 Jinas, the Jains did not distinguish them very clearly. They are all shown either standing upright or seated in meditation in the mode seen here. Depending on the order, Shvetambara or Digambara, they are clothed or naked respectively. They have the same hairstyle as the Buddha but without the cranial bump. With the
exception of three, most Jinas can be identified by the depiction of their mount on the pedestal or their attendants who are called yaksha (male) and yakshi (female).
In this instance neither can the attendants be identified nor is there a symbolic marker on the pedestal. Nevertheless it is a classic Jain ensemble in the style that has become well established as “Akota”, from the site in Gujarat which yielded a large number of bronzes with even more elaborate compositions. Some have inscriptions which inform us that the
metal images were generally dedicated in temples as acts of piety.

PARSHVANATHA,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/B32.jpg,"PARSHVANATHA
B 32
DESCRIPTION
This is one of the earliest images of Parshvanatha belonging to the 1st–2nd century CE and is also an interesting example of bronze casting in India of this period. Though the image is compared to the Bapatla bronzes by Nihar Ranjan Ray, the modelling of tubular long legs, wide long eyes, and slightly pouting parched lips remind one of the Mohen-jo-Daro dancers. The snail-shell curls on his head and large eyes indicate its proximity to the early Mathura sculptures, whereas other features such as a slightly bulging abdomen and the coils of the snake attached to the image separately as an applique work, point to a more archaic origin. As suggested by U.P. Shah, it could indicate a continuation of the bronze casting techniques of the Indus Valley period up to the 2nd century BCE.
Parshvanatha stands in the Kayotsarga pose under the snake-hood spread around his head. His elongated arms, one of the signs of a great man, reach almost up to his knees. Quite unlike Parshvanatha's images of the later period, the entire length of the snake is shown in the shape of a wavy rope behind him.
It has been generally observed that in the early images of Parshvanatha, the snake has five heads. In later images, this becomes the special feature of Suparshvanatha.

This is one of the most popular Yaksha-Yakshini pairs in the Jain pantheon. Their story is associated with the 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanatha, who once saved the serpent couple from the sacrificial fire of an ascetic. Years later, when Parshvanatha was engaged in rigorous penance, the same snake couple (now reborn as Yaksha Dharanendra and Yakshini Padmavati,) saved him from drowning in the flood. The Yaksha coiled around his body and spread his protective hood over Parshavanatha’s head.
Notice that the Yaksha-Yakshini pair hold similar attributes in their four hands. They have a lotus, a goad, a naga-pasa, and the fourth hand is in varada mudra. Both wear a five-tiered mukuta.
As deities, both Dharanendra and Padmavati enjoy an independent status. Padmavati is till worshipped at important family rituals for fertility by Jains today.

S 435
DESCRIPTION
The devastating iconoclastic invasion of the Muslim mercenaries in Gujarat and Rajasthan in the 13th century left a number of temples in a state of ruins. The Jain community was quick to undo its effects and engaged itself in intensive conservation activities, often recorded in the inscriptions from these areas.
The present two panels which are parts of Adinatha shrine show the donors worshipping the yaksha Gomukha (not illustrated) and yakshini Chakreshwari, the Shasanadevatas at the shrine of Adinatha. Yakshini Chakreshvari occupies a miniature shrine in the panel holding two chakras in her two upper hands. A miniature human figure is seated in front of her seat under her folded right leg. The other panel is its exact counterpart and depicts the bull-faced yaksha Gomukha with his mount elephant crouching under his seat. True to his iconographic form, he holds a goad, a noose and a citron in his three hands, while the remaining hand poses the varadamudra.
Though the human figures are of standard portrait types, the rounded modelling and sensitively carved details make these images very lively. Both, Manikya and his wife are seated facing the yaksha and the yakshini, with slightly tilted heads and with hands stylishly folded in the front. Manikya wears his hair in a large bun and has a long beard, probably a custom with the shravakas as depicted in the sculptures and paintings of the early period. His wife is adorned with prominent circular earrings, hollow in the centre, which may be the traditional ornament of their community. The artist’s ingenuity is expressed in the beautiful balloon-like curve of the odhani over the head of the female devotee in both sculptures. An identical representation of the odhani is seen in the paintings of the 12th-century Jain patlis from Western India.
The inscription mentions that the image of Adinatha in the Kanha-Vasahi was restored (jirnoddhara) by Manikya of the Pallivala family, the son of banker Ratna and Jamuna, for the merit of his father. The Jina image was consecrated by Sri Gunachandra of the Chaitra-gaccha. It is interesting that the same inscription is carved on both panels. The panels, therefore, do not seem to be a part of the pedestal of the image as is generally believed but probably occupied a place on either side of the entrance to the shrine.

DESCRIPTION
The oriental manner and etiquette of serving wine is different from the modern Western style. Wine was poured into a big bowl or deep dish and the guests would be served in small cups. This copper wine bowl belonged to the Safavid royal family. The inscription on the lower band reads:
Safiya Begum dedicated this cup to Hazrat Abdullah al Hussain, on him be Salutations.
He who will cherish greed for it will be caught up in the curse of God and hatred of the prophet.
Year 991 (Hijri) = 1582.
The bowl stands on a beautiful base. The exterior of the bowl is elaborately chiselled in bands with calligraphy and hunting scenes gently raised in very low relief against the black lacquered background. The topmost band has medallions containing Shia prayers, the durud of Nad-e-Ali. The central band depicts a hunting expedition. The calligraphy, the details
of the costumes and the rendering of the elephant and other animal figures reveal the influence of Akbar-period painting. The trees and Tai clouds are markedly Persian elements in early Mughal art. This piece reveals the excellent combination of Mughal and Persian styles. On either side of this band are Persian couplets in Nastaliq. These are twelve couplets from the Saqi-nama by the well-known mystical poet Hafiz Shirazi.

The technique of this kind of gem studding on jade objects is a substitute for the pietra-dura technique of inlay of semi-precious stones on jade or stone surface. The lapidarist follows the jeweller’s technique and before fixing the precious or semi-precious stones, the designs are appropriately foiled or painted to enhance the brilliance of the colours. The lid also has navaratna stones in a floral pattern.
Four silver balls serve as the legs of the box. Traces of gilding are visible at some places on silver areas.

DESCRIPTION
Ivory as a medium of carving has been used since very early times. It was used mainly to fashion utilitarian and decorative objects like jewellery boxes, combs, hilts of swords and daggers. However, portrait figures in ivory are very rare. This portrait of Thirumala Nayaka is unique in this context.
Thirumala Nayaka, acclaimed for his heroism and love of art was one of the important Nayaka rulers of Vijayanagar (1623–1659). Though the empire was declining by this time, the Nayaka rulers left behind an architectural legacy, the most important of which is the holy temple of Madurai, Tamil Nadu.
Here, Thirumala Nayaka stands gracefully on a high pedestal, richly adorned with jewellery, necklaces, large earrings, a broad waistband, bracelets and anklets. The transparent dhoti is probably brocaded, as traces of gold are evident. He has a sharply curved waist, stands with a slightly tilted head, and holds a dagger in his left hand. The ivory was
originally painted red.

28.5215
DESCRIPTION
With the opening up of sea trade in the 15th century, the items of Indian craftsmanship were in great demand, especially in European countries. Vishakhapattanam, a major port on the southern coast was an important centre of trade, particularly of ivory and shell work. As reported by J.K. Kippling in 1885 the jewel caskets made of ivory on tortoise shells were a speciality of Vishakhapattanam, the execution of which was delicate and their designs flawless.
The Vishakhapattanam artists seem to have mastered the technique of ivory carving. The technique employed is essentially the veneering technique and occasional fret work. Here the surface of the ivory is ornamented with designs in lac. The carved designs consist of mythological themes, animals, hunting scenes, fauna and flora. The carving of the figures is influenced by the Tanjore art style whereas the floral design all over the box bears a distinct European influence.
The box has delicately carved ivory panels on the tortoise shell and is one such example of excellent workmanship of Vishakhapattanam carving. The rectangular box has a complex structure. The inner side of the box is made of sandalwood, arranged in compartments suitable to hold jewellery pieces. The lid of each of these compartments is covered with a thin veneer of ivory painted with creeper designs. There is a figure probably of Krishna, holding a flute and snake entwined around his shoulder. The outer side made of tortoiseshell is covered with fretwork in ivory. The entire surface is covered with designs consisting of gods, goddesses, animals, birds as well as flora.
The top of the box has an elevated panel showing different designs, with a central oval panel depicting Harihara accompanied by a goddess seated on Nandi while the cows are placed in front against the beautifully carved backdrop, not easily visible to the naked eye. Of the two sages standing in salutation, one is Vyaghrapada with the legs of a tiger. The other one who is in the half human and half fish form, is Patanjali. Patanjali is believed to be an incarnation of the serpent Shesa and therefore, in later South Indian sculptures he is shown in the composite form with a human bust on top and a snake as the lower half. Vyaghrapada, a great devotee of Shiva, was provided with tiger legs to enable him to climb easily the thorny Bilwa trees to gather tender leaves for the worship of Shiva. Both of them were Shiva’s ardent worshippers.
The lower elevation shows different ornamental scenes such as horse riders, dancers, hunting scenes etc. On one side of the top is a four-handed figure while the other shows a winged figure blowing a trumpet. The right side of the box has Sarasvati, while the opposite side has a scene depicting a human figure holding a trident and standing on a snake. The front and the rear sides of the box show a hunting scene and the episode of Hanuman carrying the mountain full of life-giving medicine, for Lakshmana. Two women elegantly hold up the decorated keyhole of the box in front.

This is a superb example of the collaboration among craftsmen of the Meiji period. The body is of shibuichi, an alloy of copper and silver, with applied and carved decoration showing Emma-O, the Buddhist King of Hell, dreaming of a procession of courtesans, a humorous moralistic theme which often appears on the metalwork of this period. The dreaming deity is carved in high relief with details in applied copper, shakudo (an alloy of copper and gold which patinates to a luxurious black colour), and gold; the procession of the courtesans and her attendants on the reverse of the incense burner is executed in a similar technique. Exquisite panels of cloisonné enamel on the three legs are possibly the work of Hiratsuka Mohei or Goto Shozaburo, both of whom won prizes for their work. The finial is in the form of a humorous Oni, an ambivalent Buddhist demon, in patinated and gilt copper.
The vase was probably produced to order by the Ozeki Export Company of Yokohama who exhibited work at the First National Industrial Exposition in 1877 where they won prizes. Yamada Motonobu (1847–97), who used the art name “Inshi”, came from a family who had served as retainers to the Mito branch of the Tokugawa family. Besides receiving commissioned work from the Ozeki company, Motonobu, who moved to Edo around 1872, is also recorded as having served the imperial household in 1877.

DESCRIPTION
Mark: Kyoto Namikawa
Namikawa Yasuyuki (1845–1927) was one of the Meiji period’s foremost makers of cloisonné enamels of the highest standards. Namikawa began his career around 1868 and worked with the Kyoto Cloisonné Company from 1871 to 1874. He then established his studio and began to exhibit his work at national and international expositions, such as Philadelphia (1876), the First National Industrial Exposition, Tokyo (1877), and Paris (1878).
Yasuyuki’s cloisonné enamels are characterised by the skilful use of intricate wirework and superb attention to detail. The designs in his later work tend to be pictorial and consist mainly of scenes from nature and views of landmarks in and around Kyoto as can be seen in two of the pieces here. All of these works are characterised by a pictorial composition balanced against large expanses of pure-coloured enamel.
The vase is decorated with silver and gold wires and subtly shaded enamels, which made Yasuyuki’s work expensive and desirable. The body of the vase depicts the Shugakuin Detached Palace in Kyoto.

DESCRIPTION
Mark: [Myochin] Muneyoshi
The Myochin family of armour-makers and metalworkers claimed a lineage dating back to the early 13th century; however, there are no recognized signed pieces by the Myochin School until the 16th century. They were important makers of armour and sword fittings, particularly sword guards (tsuba), for the ruling samurai families of the Edo period (c. 1600–1867).
In this time of relative peace their skill in the manufacture of flexible armour lent itself to the production of purely decorative articulated animals (jizai) using the same techniques of riveting metal plates as those employed on armour. The Myochin were especially skilled in the production of jizai and their many fanciful animals (dragons, sea creatures, insects, etc.) were in huge demand with wealthy samurai and the ascending merchant class of Japan’s huge cities.
After the Meiji Restoration of 1868 many of the Myochin School adapted the techniques formerly used to rivet metal to create armour, to now make feathers and scales. Jizai are amazingly flexible and can be moved into different positions; this snake, when held, moves in a most naturalistic way. We do not know precisely which Muneyoshi made this piece; there were a number of makers during the Edo period using this signature and one of the last of this name lived from 1852 to 1940 and exhibited his work at the Japan- British Exhibition at the White City, London in 1910.

DESCRIPTION
Mark: unsigned
The magnificent drop-fronted cabinet is in the style that was favoured for export to Europe from around 1600 to 1800. The lock is of Western form but the cabinet is decorated all over with purely Buddhist images, motifs, and texts. It must have been made for a devout Buddhist as, following the downfall of the samurai government in 1867 with whom Buddhism had been closely linked, there was a strong move to eradicate Buddhism in Japan and, as a consequence, many Buddhist temples were destroyed and their treasures sold off to foreigners.
The exterior of the cabinet has a fine low-relief lacquer design of a lotus pool; the Buddhist imagery here is simple and understated. The details of the lotus are picked out in silver, and large areas of gold foil create a shimmering pattern on the leaves. The cabinet has three drawers with scattered lotus leaves in a style which harks back to the Buddhist-influenced lacquer of the 13th century. The most striking feature of the cabinet is the inside of the drop front which depicts the Bodhisattva Kannon on a lotus leaf with text from the Heart Sutra. Deriving from Mahayana Buddhism, the Heart Sutra has long been one of Japan’s most popular sutras and is important to the Shingon Buddhist sect.

Mark: Koso with Kao (art mark) in a cartouche of two dragons
The large dish is decorated with a humorous scene of a monkey, clad in human clothes, peering through spectacles at a netsuke in the form of a monkey. The border of the dish is divided into panels containing items associated with scholars: these include personal seals, mirrors, archaic bronzes, and a roof tile. The fine gold lacquer ground is highlighted with raised details of the monkey and its patterned jacket. The creature’s eyes are detailed behind the crystal lenses of its spectacles and its fur is naturalistically delineated in fine lines of gold on a darker lacquer.
There is a long tradition in the Japanese art of anthropomorphic depictions of animals. This can be traced back to the Choju Jinbutsu Giga (Handscroll of Frolicking Animals and People) which dates to around 1100 and depicts, among many humorous scenes, animals in human attire enacting both courtly and everyday pursuits. On this dish, the monkey examines the netsuke (toggle) of the inro (literally “seal basket” and used for personal seals as well as medicines) which is signed by a known maker, Nakayama Komin (1808–70). However, it is decorated in the Shibayama style which was popular at the time this dish was made, rather than in Komin’s more eclectic style.

DESCRIPTION
This elaborately decorated vessel in the form of an incense burner was one of the most popular forms upon which the Meiji craftsman executed his skills. The lacquer inlay art shown here is known as Shibayama; named after the Shibayama area of present-day Chiba prefecture. Shibayama lacquers typically showcase gorgeously inlaid mother of pearl, sometimes using cut ivory, tortoiseshell or coral pieces depicting flora and fauna motifs, which are then lacquered. Shibayama differs from other inlaid lacquer arts in that the intricately carved inlay pieces instead of being embedded flush into the ground material, protrude in high relief above the surface to create an applique-like design.
The highly ornate decoration of Shibayama lacquerware appealed considerably to the taste of the late 19th-century collector. Shibayama ware displayed a superb range of materials crafted with a technical virtuosity never before seen by collectors of Japanese art.

22.1868
DESCRIPTION
Mark: Ryuichi
From the beginning of the Meiji period, when the Japanese began to adopt western-style modes of dress, the traditional makers of fashion accessories had to adapt to these changes or go out of business. Ivory carvers had long made miniature works, such as netsuke — the decorative toggle used to secure the lacquer inro to the sash — but as these objects were no longer being used, carvers used their skills to produce purely decorative objects instead.
Okimono (things to be placed) were objects especially chosen to be displayed in the tokonoma (the alcove found in traditional Japanese houses). With the rapid growth in the export of ‘exotic’ traditional Japanese arts to the west and with the encouragement of the Meiji government, larger-scale ivory okimono were produced to meet this demand. High-quality naturalistic carvings such as this group were made by carvers from the newly formed Tokyo Sculptors Association (1887). Such intricately carved objects were displayed at international exhibitions and were of such high quality that they commanded huge prices and were eagerly acquired by collectors of the period.
Unfortunately, we know nothing of the history of the maker of this object.

Series: Fifty-Three Stations of Tōkaidō
The Tōkaidō highway (Eastern Sea Route) between Kyoto and Edo(now Tokyo), built in early times, rose to prominence at the beginning of the 17th century CE with the selection of Edo as the military capital of Japan. This highway is divided into 53 convenient stages or rest steps, with inns and restaurants at each. In 1832, Hiroshige was invited to join an embassy of officials to the imperial court. The resulting series of prints Tōkaidō gojūsan-tsugi [Fifty Three Stations of Tōkaidō]; a product of his sketching of the journey, was extremely successful and led to the firm establishment of his artistic reputation. The set of 55 prints (the 53 stations plus the cities of Edo and Kyoto at either end of the highway) in their unique combination of romance and realism, set a new trend in Japanese prints. This series paved the way for the depiction of the whole range of Japan’s scenic beauties in a manner that the common person could readily appreciate. When Europe rediscovered Japanese print at the end of the 19th century, Hiroshige gave Western artists such as Cezanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaugin and Van Gogh a new vision of nature.

Publisher: Takenouchi Magohachi (Hoeido)
Hiroshige started to produce landscape prints in the early 1830s. His unique style is evident in his series Famous Places in Edo and Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido. He continued to excel at views of famous places throughout his career.
In 1832, Hiroshige was invited to join an embassy of officials to the imperial court. En route, he studied the Tokaido road (eastern sea route), which wended its way along the shoreline from Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to Kyoto. His resulting series of prints of the Tokaido was extremely successful and his artistic reputation was firmly established. His woodblock prints of landscapes were incredibly influential not only in Japan but later in Europe, where his work influenced many artists of the Impressionist school. This print depicts the staging post of Tsuchiyama, a place situated in a mountain forest and known for its abundant spring rainfall.

During the Qing dynasty, many of these auspicious wish-granting wands were made as presents for the emperors to bestow on their favourite courtiers and for the courtiers to present to the emperors and empresses during the new year or on special occasions, such as birthdays and weddings.
The cinnabar lacquer handle of this wand is inset with three pieces of grey-green nephrite. The headpiece, shaped like a fungus of immortality (lingzhi), shows a basket in low relief, with another wand shown behind it. The basket contains the fungi of immortality, bamboo, narcissus, and a peach. Together, these form a pictorial pun representing the phrase “May the heavenly immortals bring birthday greetings”. The jade plaque in the centre shows a bat (pun for blessings) hovering above a branch of peaches (symbol of immortality) to represent blessings and longevity. In the last piece, a fungus of immortality grows next to a rock. Together, they convey a wish for longevity.
The multiple longevity symbols on this wand indicate that it is a birthday gift. The yellow tassels give further proof that it is originally from the Qing palace, yellow being the imperial colour.

22.594
DESCRIPTION
The well-potted body of globular shape rises to an elegant flaring neck, the exterior glazed a dark red stopping short of the white glazed rim and the neat foot.
Jihong or “sacrificial red” is a glaze associated with the annual rites of worship performed by the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Porcelain vessels associated with these annual worships were glazed in the four colours of blue, yellow, red, and white. According to the Ming dynasty publication Daming huidian (Collected Statues of the Great Ming Dynasty), in the ninth year of Jiajing (1530), sacrificial vessels were to be glazed blue for the Altar of Heaven, yellow for the Altar of the Earth, red for the Altar of the Sun, and white for the Altar of the Moon.
The Qing dynasty emperors revived the Ming tradition of annual sacrifices at these altars in Beijing and vessels continued to be glazed in these colours. The colour of this red glaze is too dark to be a successful attempt, but it is still an imperial piece.

DESCRIPTION
Mark: inscription carved in a later period daoguang xinchou taiyuan zunji (see below)
The beaker vase with rounded shoulders tapers down to an elegantly narrow foot. The neck constricts slightly before flaring out to a wide trumpet mouth. The decoration consists of eight leaf-shaped reserve panels depicting the Eight Immortals (the most famous group of Daoist adepts) against a diaper ground.
The Eight Immortals are people from various walks of life, who, having absorbed the Elixir of Life, became immortals and are worshipped as gods of longevity. Zhongli Chuan, leader of the eight, appears on the neck of the vase. He carries a fan which revives the dead. Below him on the right is Lan Caihe, holding her basket of flowers. Next to her is the elderly Zhang Guolao whose attributes are the bamboo fish drum and two metal beaters, while below him is the youthful Han Xiangzi, patron of musicians, playing his flute. On the body of the piece, Cao Guojiu is shown directly below the leader of the Eight Immortals. Cao alone among the eight came from a noble background, for he was brother-in-law to the emperor of China, and he appears as a nobleman playing the wooden clappers. The cripple beggar on his right is Li Tieguai, holding his iron crutch and magic gourd emiting vapours. Next to him is the handsome Lu Dongbin, carrying a scroll and wearing a sword behind him. Below is He Xiangu shouldering a bamboo sieve. Among the Eight Immortals, only He Xiangu’s attribute changes with time. During the 18th century, the bamboo sieve becomes a lotus leaf or blossom. In this example, the sieve follows the Ming dynasty formula.
As indicated by the inscription, this vase was dedicated to Taiyuan, the Supreme Primogenitor of the Daoist religion, in 1841, by a follower named Zun.

DESCRIPTION
The shape of this vase is rather unusual, having a flaring mouth, swelling neck, a slightly constricted waist and a bulbous belly resting on a flaring foot. The blue glaze, like the previous example, is of the salan type. The gold decoration is finely executed, showing a combination of floral motifs and the classical treasures (bogu). This design is also known as “hundred antiques,” a popular subject for Chinese decorative art since the early 17th century. Included in “hundred antiques” are various auspicious symbols, vessels of antiquity, and objects of religious and worldly traditions. In China, the “hundred” in this case means “many,” and does not necessarily restrict the motif to exactly a hundred objects.
The reserve panels in the section beneath the mouth rim display the classical treasures motif of still life groupings depicting ancient vessel shapes and vases on fancy stands. This is followed by a band of flowers, and flowers in reserves against a diaper background. The belly has reserves of various shapes and sizes, filled with different flowers, chrysanthemums (a flower of autumn which symbolizes longevity) and objects among the “hundred antiques” such as the chessboard (one of the four scholarly pursuits).

33.1374
DESCRIPTION
Mark: six-character mark daqing daoguang nianzhi (produced during the Daoguang period of the great Qing dynasty)
The flower vase with a flaring mouth and constricted waist is shaped like an ancient wine container known as gu, whose shape went back to pre-Bronze Age China. The all-over decoration of opaque overglaze polychrome is reminiscent of those seen on cloisonné pieces, and consists of borders of ruyi lappets and thunder pattern, enclosing the Eight Auspicious Buddhist symbols tied with ribbons, incorporated into a pattern of stylized lotus and foliate scroll. This gu-shaped vase actually formed part of five offering vessels commonly found on Chinese altars. They consist of an incense burner, two candlesticks, and two vases. Many such sets were made in the Qianlong period, and they continued to be made in the Daoguang period when the grandson of the Qianlong emperor was the ruler of China.
The Eight Auspicious symbols first made their appearance as decorations on celadons and blue-and-white porcelain vessels of the Yuan dynasty. Originating from India, these symbols were most possibly introduced to China during the Yuan dynasty by Anige, the famous Newari artist of Nepal. Anige went to Dadu (Beijing) on the recommendation of the Sakya lama Phagpa, and he worked for Kublai Khan for many years. After the Yuan dynasty, the Eight Auspicious symbols soon became popular motifs for decorating objects associated with Buddhist worship.

22.506
DESCRIPTION
Commonly called Kraak porcelain, this type of ceramic ware is possibly named after Portuguese merchant ships known as carracks. Kraak wares are thinly potted and are characterised by chipped rims. Besides being made for export, they were also used domestically, examples of which have been excavated from tombs in the Jiangxi province with a range of dates from 1573 to 1645. Such wares were assumed to have been made at Jingdezhen but their exact places of production have yet to be reliably identified.
In 1603, the Dutch captured the carrack Catherina, which was carrying a rich cargo of silk, porcelain, and lacquer wares, in the Straits of Malacca. The cargo was sold for over three million guilders in Amsterdam and caused a sensation. Not only did such porcelain begin to appear in Dutch still-life paintings in the early 17th century C.E. but it also played a pivotal role in influencing the development of European pottery and was widely copied in pottery centres such as Delft.
The central panel of this plate shows peonies and chrysanthemums growing next to a Taihu rock, with bees hovering above. The peonies represent prosperity while the rock and chrysanthemums symbolise long life. On the cavetto are twelve panels of flowers, with a scalloped edge whose glazes have flaked off in areas.

DESCRIPTION
Biting on a branch of peaches, an old man is putting on his shoe while balancing himself on one foot on a rock. The fruit identifies him as Dongfang Shuo, the mortal who stole peaches of immortality from the orchard belonging to the Queen Mother of the West, located in the Kunlun mountains to the west of China. These peaches ripened once every 3,000 years and were reserved for immortals.
Dongfang Shuo hailed from the court of Emperor Wu in the Han dynasty. Legend has it that he stole peaches on three occasions, and, thus, became immortal. He is considered a god of longevity by the Chinese.
Usually, he is shown carrying a branch of peaches and running with his clothes flying behind him, as in the jade sculpture in the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco. In this unique and finely carved example, he has paused for a moment to put on his shoe, which he had shed in his haste. To free his hands for this purpose, he holds the branch of peaches between his teeth. The sculptor has successfully portrayed him as a crafty old man, with an impish look on his face.

DESCRIPTION
Copy of an 11th-century CE fresco from Tsaparang Monastery, Tibet
A copy of a mural painting from Tsaparang Monastery (Red Temple), Tibet, this gouache painting depicts Buddha giving his first sermon after achieving enlightenment, at Deer Park, Sarnath, India. During this sermon — also known as the dharmachakrapravartana (setting of the wheel of dharma in motion) — Buddha created the Buddhist sangha, one of the tri-ratnas. It was during this sermon that he conveyed to his followers, the four noble truths and the eightfold path.
The Chinese takeover of Tibet constituted a pivotal moment in Tibet’s history, making its artistic heritage inaccessible to the rest of the world. With several of its sources inaccessible and many of its followers dispersed throughout the world, the daily experience of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism has largely been lost. As a result, the pictures and traces of Tsaparang frescoes by Li Gotami are one of the last prominent pieces of documentation of the Red Temple before the occupation.

Vaishravana Pata,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/22.1852_01_tif.jpg,"Vaishravana Pata
22.1852
DESCRIPTION
This pata forms a part of a larger composition as seen from the markings “North No. 7” and “East No. 2” at the back. The epithet “Lord-Leader of the Yaksha…” mentioned in the inscription at the back denotes Vaishravana (another name for Kubera, the Lord of the Yakshas), also corroborated by iconographic details.
In the painting, Vaishravana is seen seated on a lotus seat in ardhaparyankasana, with left leg bent and right pendant, wearing embroidered dhoti and bare-bodied except for an upavita (sacred garment) covering the shoulders and falling loosely over the arms. This is so unlike Vaishravana’s usual mail armour and high boots seen in his metal images. The figure has an angry expression; and holds a sword and a mongoose in his hands. His expression in the first is enhanced by his coiffure that resembles flame tips. Both figures are framed by pilasters supporting a trefoil arch.
In the top corners of the pata, Garuda appears in the right corner, instead of Vajrapani. What is enigmatic is that all three Vajrapanis are shown wearing characteristic tazig (Persian cloak) and slippers. The red and blue background in both paintings has a delicate, sensitive floral design, perhaps inspired by the Chinese and Persian silk cloth (zo-og) regularly imported into Tibet.
Another unusual feature is the Buddhist creed “Ye dharma…etc.” inscribed in Newari characters as a bold border around each painting. Possibly the paintings were commissioned by a Nepali patron and the inscriptions were added late.
The text of the Tibetan inscriptions on the paintings, read for us by David Templeman, is as follows:
On the reverse:
“north no. 7

As for the Lord-Leader of the Yaksha

Buddha Akshobhya,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/47.jpg,"Buddha Akshobhya
2009.602
DESCRIPTION
The base of the image on the back carries a Newari inscription which informs us that this image of Akshobhya Tathagata (Buddha) was dedicated by Jivamuni Simha to mark the death of his father Jivanasimha in the year 741 of the Newari era corresponding to 1641 CE. Thus, not only does it date the sculpture but provides us with interesting information that it is a memorial commission. The Buddha Akshobhya may well have been their family deity, or perhaps the donor wished his father to go to the paradise of Akshobhya
.The sculpture is also art-historically interesting as it clearly shows the archaizing tendencies of Nepali art and the dangers of dating undated works. Had the inscription not been added it is quite likely that the Buddha with his beautifully chased cushion would have been dated much earlier. Indeed, the figure clearly echoes stylistic elements of 10th–11th century works.
The three separately made pieces have been skilfully assembled to create a sumptuous composition. The great monk’s simple form is contrasted with the typically busy throneback with a variety of mythical creatures such as makara, garuda, and naga. Their dynamic forms, swirling, foliating tails, along with luxuriant, stylized vegetal and flame motifs create a rich tapestry. His head surrounded by a halo, the tranquil Buddha makes the earth-touching gesture (bhumisparshamudra), there by announcing his imperturbability (akshobhya). Given to Buddha Shakyamuni, the gesture symbolizes his steadfastness against the assault of Mara. The tiered pedestal is quietly adorned with two elephants in the recesses with a wheel on the projected facade, all symbols of the Buddha.

DESCRIPTION
This is a classic image of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara who has remained an extremely popular deity among the Newar Buddhists. He has been frequently represented in Nepali art and the history of the type of portrayal seen here can be traced back at least to the 5th century.
One of the earliest bodhisattvas in the Mahayana Buddhist pantheon, Avalokiteshvara (literally all-seeing lord) became a focus of independent worship in India as early as the Kushan period (1st–3rd century). Because his principal hand symbol is a lotus, he is also known as Padmapani. An embodiment of compassion, he is characterized as the “Saviour of the World” whose lotus hand extended in charity drips nectar of pity for all sentient beings.

B 42
DESCRIPTION
This bronze image of a chovisi, meaning a group of the twenty-four Tirthankaras (Jain teachers), is an exquisite image of the Rashtrakuta period from the Deccan. The central figure is that of the first Jaina Tirthankara Rishabhanatha, standing erect in the meditative Kayotsarga posture. His broad chest is glowing with the golden shrivatsa mark indicative of his enlightened state.
The remaining twenty-three Tirthankaras are depicted in miniature on the parikara (aureole) around him. Parshvanatha seated in a niche in the topmost row is identifiable by the cobra-hood over his head. The parikara is surmounted by a canopy done in the typical style of the region. The Gandharvas (celestial musicians) and the apsaras (celestial dancers), standing in identical poses, create a beautiful pattern along the periphery of the parikara. The elegantly-dressed chauri (fly-whisk) bearers stand in the dvibhanga posture, with the left leg slightly bent. They are both on the sides of the main image. The lotuses emerging from the left and right of the pedestal provide the base for the chauri-bearers and also the seats for the attendants the yaksha Matanga and the yakshini Ambika. Matanga holds a citron in his right hand and a mongoose in his left, while Ambika, has a child seated on her left lap. She holds a twig of the mango tree in her right hand. The nine figures carved on the pedestal are probably the Navagrahas, the nine planets.

2009.536
DESCRIPTION
Images of the mischievous but endearing child Krishna are among the most charming created by south Indian artists, especially in metal. A favourite was that in which the naked toddler is shown dancing in joy holding a butter ball in his
right hand. Symbolically the ball may also double as the universe, as it does in the hand of the adult Vishnu who is no different from Krishna. The pedestal with rings and the circular base make it clear that this was meant to be a processional image but without these supports the representation is remarkable for its naturalism and spontaneity.
The robust toddler with plump but muscular legs is given a belly bloated with the butter and other goodies he has consumed. He is naked except for various ornaments as befitting a child from an affluent family. Noteworthy is the necklace with a pair of tiger claws that he wears as a talisman. The only unnatural part of his anatomy is the profusion of his hair and its sophisticated arrangement into a crown, unlikely for his tender age. His posture too is that of an accomplished dancer rather than a prankster child. The step he takes with his right leg is expertly balanced by the graceful extension of his left arm, as if he has mastered the technique.
Curious is the depiction of the pupils of his eyes in his boyish face that seem to make him squint. A sculpture of great charm and originality, this dancing figure of the jubilant butter thief remains a fascinating realisation of the lively theme by an unknown master sculptor of a Karnataka workshop at the height of the Vijayanagara empire, perhaps under the great monarch Achyutaraya (1529–42).

B 68.1
DESCRIPTION
A FORM OF VISHNU
Vishnu manifested himself in twenty-four forms. These forms are identified by the order of the ayudhas (emblems) placed in his four hands. Here, Vishnu stands in Samapadasthanaka (straight) pose on a circular lotus resting on a pedestal. He holds a mace in the upper right hand, a disc in the upper left hand and a conch in the lower left hand. The lower right hand is in the varada, (boon-bestowing) mudra. By the positions of the different emblems held in his hands, this bronze can be identified as the Trivikrama form of Vishnu.
According to the story, Bali the king of the Asuras extended his authority over the three worlds inflicting an overall defeat on the gods. Vishnu assumed the form of Vamana (dwarf) and approaching Bali, asked him to give him as much space as could be measured by three of his footsteps. Bali agreed to this. Vishnu then enlarged himself to such a great size that he covered the two worlds with his two steps. Then he questioned Bali about the third step. Bali offered his head: Vishnu stepped on it and pushed him to Patal Loka (hell). Thereafter, Vishnu was known as Trivikrama.
Notice the three-pointed mukuta (crown), karna-kundalas (earrings), bajuband (armlets), Kada (bracelets), necklaces, yajnopavita (sacred thread), katisutra (girdle of the waist), and uru dama (thigh jewellery). The decorative vanamala (flower garland) hangs from the shoulders to the knees. Vishnu is flanked by Shridevi and Sarasvati.
We see Sarasvati as his consort only in Eastern Indian sculptures. Elsewhere Sarasvati is replaced by Bhudevi. Behind Vishnu’s head is a leaf-shaped halo. The Prabha (halo), has the usual flamboyant border surmounted with a circular chhatra (umbrella) at the top - a feature of Eastern Indian bronzes.

DESCRIPTION
Every eleventh day of the lunar cycle in each month of the Hindu calendar is known as ekadashi. Devotees of Vishnu observe Ekadashi vrata with pious observances like fasting and pilgrimages. The Ekadashis in the bright halves of the months Ashadha (June-July) and Kartika (October-November) are most important. It is believed that Lord Vishnu falls asleep in Kshirsagara – cosmic ocean of milk – on Sheshanaga, the cosmic serpent for four months and awakes from his lumber after four months on Kartiki Ekadashi. These four months (Chaturmasa) are prescribed for penance, austerity, bathing in holy rivers, worship and charity.
Ashadhi ekadashi is a very auspicious day and important to varkari smpradaya. Several days before the ekadashi the varkaris- devotees of Vitthal start their pilgrimage in groups on foot (dindi) singing devotional songs and reach the Vitthal temple at Pandharpur, Maharashtra

DESCRIPTION
Ceiling slab from Huchchappaiyya Gudi temple
PRIOR to the creation of this universe, Vishnu created Brahma lying on the primordial waters of Kshirasagara. This myth is symbolically represented in the form of Sheshashayi Vishnu. This image is distinguished by a unique composition and a very sensitive treatment of this particular theme. Quite unlike the other Sheshashayi Vishnu images lying straight on the coils of Serpent Ananta, in this sculpture he is slightly turned to his right supporting his head with his upper right hand. The serpent-hood is also slightly turned to the right to be exactly above Vishnu’s head. The centre of the serpent-hood aligns exactly with the top left corner of the slab deviating noticeably from other sculptures where it is generally in the centre of the panel. As his hands are resting comfortably on the Adishesha, his emblems the chakra and Gada are placed horizontally on the bed near his right hand, while shankha is near his left hand. Shri Devi and Bhudevi are seated by his side and the winged Garuda in the right corner is standing in adoration of the god. Mutilated figures of Madhu and Kaitabha are placed on the top. Vishnu is adorned with Kiritamukuta, Yajnopavita, armlets, bracelets, and a necklace popularly known as optimal or necklace of coins. The folds of his transparent dhoti beautifully merge with the stripes on the coils of the serpent.
The slab is bordered on the two vertical sides by meandering floral scrolls.

DESCRIPTION
EVERY inch of this large slab is carved with profuse iconographic and decorative details of the myth of Vishnu reclining on the serpent Shesha also known as Ananta. The panel is not carved as a single-level bas-relief as usual. The artist has imaginatively used the available thickness of the stone slab to place the figures on different receding levels of the space which lends greater dimension to the relief. Vishnu is reclining on a bed of serpent coils, spread on a cot, supporting his head on his upper right hand. Goddess Lakshmi seated near his feet is partially mutilated. The warriors on the panel behind Vishnu are the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. The artist’s ability for detailing is seen in the carving of the deep undercuts, the pillow below the head of Vishnu, the joints and the two front legs of the cot and the decorative design on the stool on which Lakshmi is seated.

S 88
DESCRIPTION
This larger than life size single image of Garuda is shown in human form, identified by his two tiny wings. He is symbolically represented here performing the feat of bringing the nectar belonging to Indra for the nagas who had cheated his mother and enslaved her. As narrated in the Mahabharata, the nagas, the children of Kadru, cheated Garuda’s mother Vinata and enslaved her. They agreed to restore her freedom provided Garuda brought them the nectar from Indra. Garuda performed many feats and reached the place where the pot of nectar was kept. Two rotating wheels protected the pot and below the wheels were two monstrous serpents. Garuda overpowered them and carrying the pot of nectar in his beak, he rose to the sky, shielding the pot from the rays of the sun by his wings. He also defeated Indra who blessed Garuda that he would live by eating the nagas.
The sculpture depicts Garuda in the act of flying with his outstretched wings suggestively placed behind his shoulders. His right hand is raised up for protection from the sun. A serpent, is loosely hanging from his left hand. His right leg is firmly planted on the ground and the left one is placed on the small pedestal supported by the two serpents whom he had defeated. His beautifully chiseled face is in three-quarter profile, as he is looking sideways. He is royally adorned with a high tiara and various ornaments. It is rare to find such a powerful image of Garuda.

S 108
DESCRIPTION
The image is intended for a regular ceremonial ritual of the worship of Shiva-Parvati and family. The rectangular Gauripatta, the receptacle on which the image has been installed has an outlet to drain out the ablution water. As daily ablutions are implied, the image must have been made for the main shrine of a small temple.
Shiva and Parvati are standing side by side, passing an arm on each other’s shoulder in an embrace. Shiva’s face is carved in three-quarter profile as he looks at the face of Parvati. Out of the other three hands, his two upper arms hold the trident and the damaru, while his lower right hand holds an akshamala. Parvati holds a lotus in her left hand. Richly ornamented figures, with beautiful jatabhara of Shiva and coiffure of Parvati, make them appear like a royal couple. The family is completed by a miniature Ganapati and Kumara seated on his mount peacock, on either side at the bottom of the parikara.
Shiva’s mount Nandi and Ganesha’s vehicle, the mushaka, are carved in front of the pedestal. This is a simplification of the earlier lotus pedestals which now take the shape of an ordinary furniture. This kind of pedestal however, became popular in Karnataka and Maharashtra.
The Kanarese inscription on the pedestal states that the image was a gift of Revakabbarasi, the wife of Vavanarasa, a feudatory of the western Chalukya king Jayasimha II (1015–42 CE).

DVARAPALA,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/S577.jpg,"DVARAPALA
S 577
DESCRIPTION
THE sculpture must have originally occupied the left side niche of the base of the door jamb of a lost temple of Shiva at Shamalaji. The right side dvarapala (lower image) is almost identical to this one except for the glass eyes which are attached later. It also shows heavy polish due to the anointment by the people who worship it as Shiva today.
The image is conceived to be guarding the abode of Shiva standing either in front of a cave or at the foot of the Himalayas, as indicated by the carving of the background in the upper half of the stele. He stands stretching his right leg a little, giving a graceful tilt to his body and the curled folds of his dhoti near his waist support his relaxing left hand. The Trishula held in his right hand is supported vertically on the ground, while the serpent around his shoulders is looking around as if exploring the surrounding environment. The ornaments, folds of the dhoti, the mukuta and the tassels of his hair, as also the details of the mountain with indications of trees, are meticulously carved, giving a distinctive appearance to each of these details, on this fine-grained schist. Though the proportion of the left arm is slightly distorted, the artist shows remarkable mastery over the modelling of the body contours, the fleshy roundness of the chest, the abdomen and the loins and creating rhythmic patterns by gentle curves wherever possible, as seen in the postures of the attendants who reflect the rhythm of the main figure. The image offers a very interesting comparison with the contemporary image of Shiva from Parel.

DAKSHINAMURTI,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/66.1.jpg,"DAKSHINAMURTI
B 66.1
DESCRIPTION
The image does not conform to any of the so-far known iconographic forms either in literature or in sculpture. Scholars have earlier identified it as Vrishabharudha Shiva because of the presence of the Nandi.
However, the mudras and the emblems displayed by Shiva identify him as Dakshinamurti. He holds a lotus and a bowl in his upper hands, while the lower left is in vitarka mudra and the lower right rests on his knee positioned in the varada mudra. Vitarka mudra is particularly associated with Dakshinamurti, who is the embodiment of Knowledge. The thumb and the pointing finger brought together as in the vitarka mudra suggest the ultimate oneness of the jivatman with the Paramatma as explained by Sayana in his commentary on the Dakshinamurti stotra.
Shiva is seated in Lalitasana, his body gracefully bent in dvibhanga. Dakshinamurti on Nandi seems to be a local iconographic development of eastern India which may have emerged following the popular Buddhist form of Simhanada Lokesvara or Yamari. A much later image of Dakshinamurti on Nandi is also found in Orissa. The images of Nataraja dancing on the Nandi preserved in the Karachi Museum and the Dacca Museum are also from the eastern India.

SHIVA GANA,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShivaGana_S-61.1.jpg,"SHIVA GANA
S 61.1
DESCRIPTION
The Ganas, Shiva’s followers, are dwarves. They are revered as minor deities. This sculpture is true to the description of the Shiva Gana in the Vishnudharmottara Purana. Here, we have a fat and short Gana resting on his left knee. His right leg is bent in a posture later associated with devotees like Hanuman. The Gana’s right arm is raised in a supporting stance, while the left hand is placed on the girdle at his waist. His long hair is arranged in curls and is spread around his head. The protruding teeth and bulging eyes add to his fierce demeanour. Notice the two different kinds of earrings. This feature is often seen in Shaivite sculptures.
The circular grain formation of the red sandstone enhances the smoothly carved roundness of the thighs and belly. The natural modelling of the figure, the slightly turned face and the position of the arms and legs lend a certain rhythm to the stone image.
This Shiva Gana image was excavated from the Ataria Khera mound at Khoh, in Central India.

DESCRIPTION
Ganesha, the god of wisdom, whose celebrations are organised every year with great pomp and show in Maharashtra, is the favourite deity of the region. His fat and chubby body are exquisitely modelled depicting all the required details of his iconography. He holds his broken tusk, a bowl of sweets and a lotus bud in three hands. The fourth, the upper right hand is broken. Ganesha wears a serpent girdle tied with a knot in the front. His mount mushaka (rat) occupies a prominent position on the pedestal.
Among the many stories about how Ganesha got his elephant head, this one from the Puranas is the most popular: Parvati, consort of Shiva, prepared for her bath after a long period of austerities. From the dust and oil of her body, she created an image of a boy and bid him stand guard. While she was bathing, Shiva returned from his meditations and was stopped by the boy. The angry Shiva cut off his head. Seeing this, Parvati was distraught and furious. She threatened to take on the form of Shakti and destroy the heavens and the earth. To pacify her, Shiva sent his Ganas to bring him the first
head facing North (the direction associated with wisdom). The first head was an elephant’s. Shiva placed the head on the boy’s body, with the blessing that Ganesha would be the first to be worshipped on every auspicious occasion.

S 152
DESCRIPTION
There was some controversy about the identification of this image. Shri Hirananda Shastri is mainly guided by a few decipherable letters of a much later inscription on its pedestal identified as an image of Sadashiva. This pedestal was found lying just in front of the image of Brahma. The reading of the inscription, however, is not certain as the letters are not quite legible. Also one cannot ignore the fact that Shiva, who is a yogi is unlikely to be carved a pot-bellied figure as represented in this image. The possibility of it being an image of Brahma is also strengthened by the presence of the paw of a swan, the mount of Brahma, on this fragmented pedestal.
Only the four faces and the bust of this life-size image have survived. He is adorned with various ornaments, a necklace, hollow-cast earrings, a torque, and a thick necklace and also wears the skin of an antelope and yajnopavita on his shoulder. The design of his moulded earrings has continued till today. Similar earrings are occasionally seen worn by some Koli women of this area who still prefer traditional ornamentation.
The image is carved in the round only up to the lower part of the neck of the rear side. The artist has carved a smooth vertical slab at the back, probably to fix the image on vertical support. This is the only known figure from Elephanta which is carved in the round and is to be seen from all four sides. Hence, it is probable that the sculpture was installed in the shrine for the devotees to do pradakshina or circumambulation.
There are diverse opinions on the original placement of this image at Elephanta. Evidence indicate that it was installed in the main shrine which is occupied at present by a Shiva linga. There are reasons to believe that this could have been a well-known shrine of Brahma at Elephanta. The shrine of Brahma at Puri (Gharapuri) must have been so important and sacred that King Dantidurga refers to his pilgrimage to the Brahma temple at Puri, among one his important religious acts in the Manor inscription. The inscription records the grant of a village Tambasahika (modern Tamsahi near Manor) in favour of a temple at Sripura. Sripura near Manor is identified by scholars as Puri or Gharapuri.

CHAMUNDA,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/014-Chamunda.jpg,"CHAMUNDA
98.5
DESCRIPTION
CHAMUNDA is an embodiment of the most fierce aspect of the cosmic energy manifested in the female form. As narrated in the Devi Mahatmya, sometime after the Great Goddess Durga killed Mahishasura, the gods approached her to kill the two mighty demons Shumbha and Nishumbha who had collected a huge army of several fierce demons and were terrorising the gods. When the fight ensued, they sent their generals one after the other to defeat the Goddess. When their powerful generals Chanda and Munda advanced towards her with their army, she turned dark with anger and created Kali, out of her eyebrows, to kill both of them.
Kali was given the name Chamunda by the Great Goddess herself when she slew Chanda and Munda. During the same battle, Chamunda also performed a horrific act of drinking the blood of the demon Raktabija, each drop of whose blood could give instantaneous birth to mighty demons, if fallen on the earth.
She is supposed to have a terrible countenance, gaping mouth with fangs, lolling tongue and deep sunken eyes. Though in the Devi Mahatmya itself she is armed only with a sword and a noose, later texts endow her with multiple arms. She enjoys a prominent position particularly in the Tantric rituals.
The image is a powerful representation of Chamunda, seated on a pedestal resting her left foot on a corpse, holding vajra, damaru, khadga, akshamala, khatwanga and kapala in her six hands, the remaining two being broken. She looks fierce with her two fangs jutting out of the corners of her mouth and her bulging eyes. Flames emanating from her head form a halo. Probably following the characteristic of Shiva images, she also wears earrings of two different designs in her ears. She is also adorned with a necklace, armlets, udarbandha, kamarbandh and anklets. The details of the ornaments are sparse but her rounded body emanates considerable feminine charm.

78.83
DESCRIPTION
The late Dr Moti Chandra, a renowned art historian & former director of CSMVS, identified this as Nidhisringa or Cornucopia or the “horn of plenty”. To the ancient Greeks, it was a symbol of plenty, of nature’s productivity. It was one of the horns of Amalthea, the goat who nursed the god Zeus when he was a baby. The horn produced ambrosia and nectar, the food and drink of the gods.
In Roman mythology, the cornucopia was the horn of the river god Achelous. The hero Heracles broke off the horn in combat with Achelous who was fighting in the form of a bull. Water nymphs filled the horn with flowers and fruit and offered it to Copia, the goddess of plenty. Cornucopia was thus associated with the Roman goddess Fortuna and Copia which explains its name.

IV 483
DESCRIPTION
The weights were used primarily for market exchange but may also have been used for taxation. The Harappan stone weights are distinct from West Asian weights. However, the system is identical to that used by the First Kingdoms of the Gangetic Plain around 300 BCE and is still in use today in traditional markets throughout Pakistan and India. The Harappans used hexahedra, popularly known as cubical weights of chert and agate, adhering to a predetermined standard adopted throughout the Indus. The stone weights vary in size from 1.1 * 1.7 * 0.7 cm to 4.1 * 4.1 * 3.4 cm. The weights are based on a complex system of measurements that are calculated by both binary and decimal increments. This level of standardisation indicates a well-developed network of internal trade.

However, the system is identical to that used by the First Kingdoms of the Gangetic Plain around 300 BCE and is still in use today in traditional markets throughout Pakistan and India. The Harappans used hexahedra, popularly known as cubical weights of chert and agate, adhering to a predetermined standard adopted throughout the Indus. The stone weights vary in size from 1.1 * 1.7 * 0.7 cm to 4.1 * 4.1 * 3.4 cm. The weights are based on a complex system of measurements that are calculated by both binary and decimal increments.

Hangul or Kashmir Stag,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hangul.jpg,"Hangul or Kashmir Stag
NH--
DESCRIPTION
Scientifc name: Cervus elaphus hanglu
The hangul or Kashmir stag is the last Asiatic survivor of the red deer subspecies and is found in the lush green forests of Dachigam National Park in Kashmir. The male deer have impressive antlers. The colour of hangul’s coat is brownish red, which is why it is also called red deer. This colour can vary with the season and the age of the hangul: in an older hangul, the coat is dark brown. Male hangul stags have long hair along their necks while females do not. The fawns have spots over the body.
The hanguls are usually seen in family groups. After shedding their antlers between March and April, most stags migrate uphill and congregate near the snow line in the Dachigam National Park. Around the end of September, when the stag’s new antlers have hardened, they commence to roar and challenge. By the beginning of October, the stags join the herd of female deer for mating. During their annual period of sexual activity they fight other stags for access to the females. The fawns are born the following May.
In the recent past, the areas of Dachigam National Park have been encroached on by livestock, nomads, and graziers.
The hangul is endangered and protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

This saw is an extension of the skull. It is made up of cartilage and is covered in skin. The number of teeth can vary depending on the species and can be anywhere from 14 to 37 teeth per side.
Sawfishes are among the largest species of fish on the planet and can reach a length of up to 7.6 metres. These fishes can be spotted around the world, inhabiting tropical and subtropical areas in coastal marine and brackish estuarine waters, along with freshwater rivers and lakes.
Unfortunately, these magnificent creatures are critically endangered. This is furthered by the relatively slow breeding speed of this species. Interestingly, sawfishes give live births, instead of laying eggs. They usually feed on other fishes and invertebrates that they detect and hunt using their saw.
This particular specimen is special because they saw that it harbours is real. The rest of the body is made through the process of casting wherein the body of this specimen was made through the impression of a real sawfish.

Gauntlet Sword,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22.3660.jpg,"Gauntlet Sword

DESCRIPTION
Called a patta, this is an unusual, interesting sword developed by the Marathas. It has a gauntlet hilt and a long, double-edged, flexible blade. The gauntlet hilt covers the arm up to the elbow. A thin steel strap inside the hilt's upper end anchors it to the forearm. The sword is gripped by a crossbar inside the hilt, which is padded so that the hand fits inside comfortably.
The long length of the blade makes the patta difficult to wield. Only expert swordsmen with strong forearms and upper-arm muscles can use it. The patta is well suited for horsemen. As the blade is long and flexible, it can be easily used sitting on a horse. If it hits a hard and resistant object it merely bends, thus, preventing the rider from being unhorsed.
The hilt of this patta has designs in relief, with a pair of lions in combat and foliated patterns all over. Most Maratha swords have similar simple designs in relief, which indicates that the Marathas were more concerned about the functionality of their swords rather than their appearance.

DESCRIPTION
Believed to bestow victory on its owner, jade as a medium was favoured by the Mughal emperors as seen in the variety of cups, dishes, boxes, as well as hilts of daggers and swords of this period.
Emperor Jahangir was a great lover of nature, and the jade fashioned during his period is richly ornamented with representations of flora and fauna. He describes various animals and birds in his memoirs, Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri. Among these were varieties of goats and sheep. At one place, he notes a kind of sheep called Rang, which caught his attention because of the ram’s curved horns, such as the one depicted in this hilt. The head of the ram provided a suitable decoration for the hilts of small arms such as the dagger, as the apt shape provided an excellent grip. Such hilts are called meshamukhi (ram’s head).
The craftsman of this hilt is perfectly at ease with his medium and has been able to depict all the important features of the animal including the small beard, round eyes, upturned ears, and beautifully textured and curved horns, balancing the rhythm of the curved blade. The blade is of watered steel, and richly ornamented with gold damascening on its ricasso.
It may be noted that the hilts of daggers and swords were made separately and attached later to blades according to the user’s choice.

DESCRIPTION
Khanda is a sword with a straight blade which broadens slightly towards the end and terminates in a rounded tip. It is one of the oldest and the most typical Indian swords. The earliest representation of this type is found in the friezes of the Rani Gumpha cave in Udaigiri dating to the 2nd century CE.
The blade of the sword is typical with a decorative strengthening plate at the edge. The hilt has a broad plate guard and wide finger guard which joins the round flat pommel. A slanting spike on the pommel could have acted as a hand rest. The plate guard and the finger guard are padded while the grip is covered with leather. A Sword knot or the sword guard was attached to the sword to avoid the loss of the weapon during combat. Before drawing out the sword the hand was slipped through the loop to grip the hilt so that even if the weapon slipped from the hand it remained hanging on the wrist. The inscription on the sword reads: Sikada Shah Khalji Allauddin Sultan. This inscribed sword of Alauddin Khilji is perhaps the earliest available historical sword in the country.

Shield of Emperor Akbar,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/22.4112_01.jpg,"Shield of Emperor Akbar
22.4112
DESCRIPTION
This grand shield belonged to Emperor Akbar. It is made of high quality watermark steel and has detailed damascene work in gold.The Ain-i-Akbari mentions four kinds of shields – sipar, dhal, khera, and pahri. This is a sipar, which was common in Mughal India. Sipar is a Persian name for a shield made of steel or hide, generally from 43 to 60 cm in diameter. If made of steel, the shields were often, as here, ornamented with patterns in gold.
The decorations on this shield run in three circular bands, with an effulgent sun in the centre and four damascened bosses around it. Between the upper and the leftside boss there is an inscription placed in a star, which reads: “Buland Iqbal Shahinshah Akbar ah 1002 [1593 ce]”.
The immediate band around the centre has a bold meandering pattern. Going outward, the next band has realistic representations of the twelve Zodiac signs,each with its corresponding oval label. Interestingly the human figures in the signs of Gemini, Virgo, and Aquarius are shown in European costume, which led some scholars to ascribe a later date to this shield. However, it is possible that this foreign element could have been copied from European engravings that were presented to Emperor Akbar. It should be noted here that some early paintings of Akbar’s period reflect an awareness of European art. In some of the paintings from the Tutinama (c. 1560–65 ce) several figures wear European costume.
Both Ain-i-Akbari and Akbarnama mention Akbar’s great interest in Indian astrology. Besides, Akbar’s faith in the sun was demonstrated in the new religion he founded, Din-e-ilahi. Abul Fazl records in the Ain-i-Akbari: “An order was given that the sun should be worshipped four times a day in the morning and evening and at noon and mid-night. His Majesty had also one thousand and one Sanscrit names of the sun collected and read them daily, devoutly turning towards the sun….” Emperor Akbar considered the sun auspicious, sacred, and beneficial to all, particularly to a ruler.

52.30
DESCRIPTION
The locale is Vrindavan, the hometown of Krishna. It is the hour of cow dust when Krishna and the gopas (cowherds) herd back their cows at the end of the day. It is a sight even for the gods. The left corner of the painting shows them assembled in the woods. And so have the gopis on the balcony on the right. The gopis have long awaited the glimpse of their beloved Krishna and the artist has captured that moment when they exchange quick glances with him as he passes by. The youthful Krishna, wearing wooden sandals, holding a cowherd stick and adorned with a long flower garland
looks up at the two gopis, one of whom may be Radha. His face is highlighted by a halo around it. His companion, unable to comprehend the situation, looks at him in amazement. Even today, the Godhuli Bela (The Hour of Cow Dust) is considered an auspicious moment.
The hour of cow dust is particularly celebrated on Gopashtami, the eighth day of the bright half of Kartika (November) when everybody worships the cows returning from the fields at twilight. This is the day when Krishna was formally given the status of a cowherd and was allowed to take the cows to graze.

29.6257
DESCRIPTION
Illustration to the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri
From the Muraqqa (album) of Nana Phadnis
Jahangir, the fourth Mughal emperor, spent nearly three years at Ajmer to be near the Dargah of Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, a disciple of the emperor’s mentor, Salim Chishti. The painting depicts the emperor seated in the front quadrangle, leading to the holy deg (cauldron). Poor people are gathered around the deg, from which food is served to them. This deg was a gift of Jahangir.
The day and date are recorded in the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri (memoirs of Jahangir). “On this day”, noted Jahangir in his memoirs, “it was brought, and I ordered them to cook food for the poor in that pot, and collect together the poor of Ajmer to feed them whilst I was there.”
One such cauldron was offered earlier to the Dargah by Emperor Akbar in 1567. The tradition of cooking khichdi (lentils and rice) in these two cauldrons still continues. The artist’s stroke is fine and delicate. If you look closely at the sword of the emperor you can read the benediction which says,
“Bismillah, may God grant victory.”
Standing in front of Jahangir is, probably his son Prince Khurram. Notice the emperor’s ears. He wears an earring to signify his indebtedness to Khwaja Muinuddin Chisti who saved him from his illness of 1613.
The painting has a beautiful qita (calligraphy) on the reverse.

52.1/9
DESCRIPTION
Folio from an illustrated manuscript of Amarushataka
This is one of the many paintings illustrating a hundred verses of the poet Amaru. They are written in Sanskrit and are known as the Amarushataka. Amaru composed these lyrics sometime during the late 7th or early 8th Century CE. These verses depict the expressions of love under various circumstances like quarrels, separation, reconciliation, and the reunion of lovers. The picturisation of the sentiments expressed in the lyrics is vivid and charming. The figures are set against a dark background of red, black or green. Black is used effectively, sometimes for the sky and sometimes for the architectural space to provide a background to the human figures.
The harsh monotony of the dark colours is occasionally relieved by a few stars or chirpy white birds and sometimes by the foliage in front. This painting depicts the moment of separation between the hero and the heroine. The hero declares his mission of going to far-away lands, leaving her to face the agony of parting and the uncertainty of the future. The hero, dressed in the attire of a warrior, is armed with a large shield, sword and a long lance. He consoles the heroine with a gesture of the right hand. The heroine’s gesture indicates her reluctant acceptance of the situation. Both stand in a garden pavilion, decorated with turrets, domes and arches typical of the Malwa style. This is one of the early Malwa sets of illustrations to the Amarushataka.

DESCRIPTION
Artist: Baijnath
The Rajasthani style of painting was practised not only in the various principalities of Rajasthan like Mewar, Bundi and Kota but also in the courts of the barons or Thikanedars from these regions. As a result, a new sub-style of Rajasthani paintings emerged which came to be known as the Thikana Paintings. This painting depicts Maharawat Naharsingh, the ruler of Deogarh, seated on the terrace with his wife Champavatji enjoying a dance performance.
The elegantly dressed Champavatji has a brocaded odhani (veil) around her head. The beautifully spread pleats of her skirt exhibit a rich brocade work. Naharsingh, dressed in royal attire, is seated in the centre of the carpet. He holds a small wine cup in his right hand and flowers in his left. The emerald and pearl sarpech (a decoration for headgear) and a black feather decorating his turban indicate his royal position. Vadaran Kasturi (female attendant) dressed in an orange sari stands behind him with a tray and a chuski (silver liquor decanter). A female guard holds the sword and the shield of the Maharawat. Behind Champavatji stand two attendants, one holds a tray and the other a fan. The couple is seated on a beautiful white carpet upon which a feast is laid.
The inscription on the reverse states:
The painting of Maharawat Naharsinghji with his wife, in the mood of Spring, is painted by Baijnath Chokhavat and is made at Deogarh. The painting is stored in the custody of the storekeeper of valuable costumes and jewellery on thirteenth day of the month of Bhadrapad dated Vikram Samvat 1888= 1831.

DESCRIPTION
An illustration to Gita Govinda
Nature is in its full exuberance, blooming with fragrant and colourful flowers, in the sylvan surroundings of the forest. It is time for Krishna to approach his beloved Radha who, clad in a lovely green full-sleeved dress with an ample skirt, is awaiting Krishna, coyly arranging her ornaments. On this starlit night, she prepared a bed of leaves and decorated it with flowers. She seems a little ill at ease in the great expectation of the approaching moment. On the other side, Duti, the messenger is signalling to Krishna to go to Radha. She is dressed in a green and orange skirt and has wrapped a transparent golden odhani around her. Their graceful movements, their ornaments particularly the ear ornament, sprays of flowers on the trees and thick but well-balanced vegetation, and several pairs of birds reflecting the mood of the time, mirror the artistic achievements of Kangra paintings of the late 18th century.
The moods of Radha and Krishna are projected in the classification of Nayak and nayika– hero and heroine. The nayikabheda (moods of heroine) is referred to in Gita Govinda and classified extensively by Keshavadasa in Rasikpriya. The nayika who is waiting for the lover to arrive is called Vasaksajja which means a nayika who has prepared her bed. Another folio of this series is in the K.P. Goenka Collection.

22.3563
DESCRIPTION
Moods of the heroine (nayikabheda) are a popular theme in Indian art and literature. Allegorically this human relationship refers to the aspiration of the soul for the Supreme. The theme is systematically dealt with in the famous poem Rasikapriya by Keshavadasa who lived in Orcha, Madhya Pradesh in the 16th century. This painting is inspired by Rasikapriya as indicated by an inscription on the reverse referring to the twenty-third verse of the seventh chapter of the Rasikapriya of Keshavadasa.
On a moonlit night, the heroine has dressed up with jewellery. The bed of banyan leaves is prepared under a green tree on the bank of a river, and after eagerly waiting for her lover through the night, she is now discarding all her ornaments in despair; because he betrayed her. Her pinkish complexion, thick locks of hair falling over her neck almost reaching her knees, her firm circular breasts, elongated eyes deeply engrossed in thought and sharply curved eyebrows lend an unusual charm to this painting.
Describing the Vipralabdha Nayika, Keshavadasa writes:
Vipralabdha is a nayika who is dejected.
This night the nayaka being absorbed in some work of his did not come,
Where at the flowers seemed to her darts, And perfumed things with evil stunk!
Her house a parcher’s oven seemed, Gardens to fearful forests turned,
Like fever was the cool moonbeams, Which all her body seemed to burn!
Songs were abuse, and betels made, Looked to her as if they poison were!
And all sixteen adornments appeared As if they merely were embers!

DESCRIPTION
This painting is one of the highly Indianised versions of a European print of “The Holy Family with St. Anne and the two angels” by Aegidius Sadeler, a print of which must have come to India during the reign of Jahangir. Though the theme is European, the setting is partially Mughal. The wall decoration and the front railing indicate the typical Mughal chamber while St. Joseph, trying to push aside a huge drape to allow sufficient light for St. Anne to behold the divine Child is true to the prototype. The heavily brocaded costume of Mary and a tilaka mark on her forehead cannot be missed as strikingly Indian elements. It is quite a challenge for the artist to introduce the figure of an angel in the small space behind the mother and the Child.
Considerable charm is added to the painting by rendering it in the Nim qalam, using only white contrasting with gold.
It is mounted on a beautiful large mount painted with floral motifs in gold.
Another derivation from the same painting is in the Nasser Khalili collection, but it is considerably changed to suit the Mughal artist’s imagination.

Yearning for the Beloved,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2009.6.jpg,"Yearning for the Beloved
2009.6
DESCRIPTION
Many idealized versions of the moods of nayikas are painted in Indian miniatures, following descriptions in the Gita Govinda and other similar literature. Unlike most, this painting is a more true-to-life depiction of a nayika eagerly waiting for her lover. Dressed in a dotted choli of flat blue colour, a plain red ghagra, and a blue odhani with zari decoration, she stands elegantly leaning against a champaka tree, gazing anxiously into the distance, wondering why he has not yet
arrived. She is a tall woman with a heavy chin, chubby face, small eyes, and long legs.
Long bare tree trunks on a green curved ground set against a complete void, produce a dramatic effect, along with the blue monsoon sky full of lightning. The scene, undisturbed by any other extraneous elements, intensely focuses on the
eagerness and anxiety of the expectant heroine.
Keshavadasa in his Rasikapriya (7.8) describes the thoughts of the Utka Nayika:
Is he delayed at home, or is he ill in body?
Or has he proved false to me?
Or does he fear this dark rain-swept night?

DESCRIPTION
Livre d' Heuris or the Book of Hours is a collection of prayers for private devotion for lay members of the Christian Church. Very common in the late Middle Ages and in the 16th century CE, these books accompanied believers in their daily lives and were “bestsellers” of their time. The name comes from the prayers within these books that were recited just as the monks; in the eight canonical hours according to the rule established by the Church.

Aphrodite Plate,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/33.1120.jpg,"Aphrodite Plate
33.1120
DESCRIPTION
Signed “Geo. Woodall”
The dark blue, almost black plate is overlaid with white opaque glass. The centre depicts the goddess Aphrodite floating in a turbulent sea, with rocks, seaweed, and shells in the foreground and with seagulls flying above. The border is decorated with a band of scallop shells and three trefoil panels, each with a winged cherub.
Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love (known to the Romans as Venus) is depicted at the moment of her birth. According to Hesiod she was born from the foam (aphros in Greek) and emerged fully grown. The story relates that Cronos cut off the genitals of his father, Uranus, and threw them in the sea. The foam gathered around them and was transformed into a woman. When Aphrodite came to land she was attended by Eros (Cupid to the Romans) who is perhaps represented by the cherubic figures around the border.
This plate is a remarkable example of cameo glass, in which the plain dark glass is applied with a layer of white glass (in this case about 1 mm thick). The latter was then carefully and selectively engraved to reveal the contrasting dark glass below. This technique, brought to a high level of excellence in Roman times, was revived in the 19th century by the English firm of J. and J. Northwood, whose works included a copy in glass of the Portland Vase.
George Woodall (1850– 1925) and his brother Thomas were trained at the firm but by the 1870s had moved to the cameo workshop of Thomas Webb and Sons, another successful glass company based at Stourbridge in the West Midlands.The Woodall brothers combined wheel engraving with acid etching to produce an exceptional combination of fine definition and subtle surface texture. On the plate, this is shown to particularly telling effect in the waves and in the seagulls, where their contrast with the clouds behind produces a strong illusion of space and depth.
Woodall was clearly fascinated, obsessed even, by this subject and made a number of plates and other objects on the same theme. An almost identical plate to this was made in 1892 and is the main evidence for dating proposed here. The latter was described in the factory records as “white on blue on claret plaque”. The same triple-layered technique has presumably been used here, since the dark blue, almost black substratum becomes a deep ruby red when held up to the light. Thomas Webb’s price list records that the 1892 plate was retailed for £125 and that Woodall was paid the much lower sum of £42 for his work.

DESCRIPTION
Marked in puce under the base, “Royal Worcester England”; with two further marks, “Rd No 437171” and “2340”
The two-handled vase is painted dark blue with reserved white and gilded highlights. The body is modelled at its base with an Acanthus calyx and painted on the front with a landscape within a gilt, oval vine surround. The back is decorated with a gilded vine festoon with relief veins to the leaves.
The Worcester Royal Porcelain Company was established in 1862 but had a much longer lineage, tracing its origins to the Worcester Porcelain Company, which was founded in 1751 by Dr John Wall. The new company consciously raised the artistic standards of its wares and concentrated on ornamental vases and figures modelled by James Hadley (1837–1903).
This vase, broken and repaired though it is, is a fine example of the firm’s output. Distinctly conservative, historicist even, the design owes much to the sorts of ornamental vases produced at the French royal factory of Sèvres during the 1760s and 1770s. The crisp modelling, the landscape painting, the rich blue ground, and the gilding, all seek to emulate Sèvres, although the elaborate tendril-like double handles reflect early 19th-century style too.

Artist: Jakob Zimmermann
Signed “j. zimmermann k. hofdrechsler u.sculpteurmünchen”
The theme of the cup is Bacchus, the ancient Roman god of wine, who is on the cover as an infant. The scene on the barrel shows Silenus, an old rural god and one of Bacchus’s principal followers. Silenus is usually depicted as he is here — in a state of helpless inebriation, wearing vines around his head, and supported by a raucous crowd of satyrs and maenads.
Jakob Zimmermann — whose signature is inscribed under the base of the cup — describes himself as “K[önigliche] Hofdrechsler und Sculpteur” (royal court turner and sculptor). Zimmermann established his workshop in Munich around 1863 and supplied King Ludwig II of Bavaria with many works in ivory and meerschaum during the 1860s and 1870s. Collections of vessels of ivory, wood, and other materials, often of astonishingly intricate and virtuoso design, formed an important constituent in princely kunstkammers (cabinets of curiosities).

From about 1890, and influenced by Emile Gallé, the firm became known for the production of etched cameo glass of the kind represented by this vase. It was, however, always a more commercial operation than Gallé’s, employing numerous decorators, such as Henri Bergé, who worked under the direction of Auguste.

22.4443
DESCRIPTION
Signed “Gallé”; the mount marked three times with the “tête de Minerve” for French .950 standard silver
Emile Gallé (1846–1904) was a cabinet maker and ceramicist as well as one of the key figures in Art Nouveau studio glass, especially for his cameo glass. This flask is a fine example of his verreries parlantes (speaking pieces), inscribed with quotations from poets, which he made from about 1884 onwards.
The quotation on this flask is from Poèmes philosophiques by Alfred de Vigny (1797–1863):
“L’invisible est réel. Les âmes ont leur monde.” (The invisible is real. Souls have their world.)
According to The Grove Encyclopaedia of Decorative Arts, “two or more fused layers of coloured glass were painted with an acid-resistant material and then immersed in an acid bath. The decoration was revealed in low relief and then carved to highlight the motifs. Gallé experimented with a variety of techniques and with metal foils and coloured oxides for their decorative effects and exploited such imperfections as crazing and air bubbles to create novel and often surreal effects.” All of these features are found in this remarkably concentrated little vessel.

The museum has in its collection copies of paintings done by Sayed Ahmed during the period 1918-1923. Sayed Ahmed was a well- known artist of the time and had also worked with Lady Herringham in her project. He was appointed by the Nizam in 1915 to make copies of the paintings in whose dominion Ajanta was at that time. The museum has 43 copies of Ajanta paintings which were gifted to the museum by Sir. Akbar Hydari.
The Painting displayed is a detail of Padmapani Boddhisattva from the cave-1 of Ajanta. In this painting he wears a pearl neckpiece and in the right hand he is holding a blue lotus.

People and children going to the forest to collect fire-wood became victims of this tribe. Once, Guru Nanak and his two companions Bala and Mardana went to the forest to convince this tribe to give up their cruel practice. Agitated Kauda caught Guruji and threw him in the cauldron of hot oil. But with his divine power the oil and the fire became cold and Guru Nanak stood up on the cauldron with a smiling face. Guruji stepped out and recited Gurubani (Compositions of Guruji). Kauda realised his mistake and repented. Guruji advised him to earn his living through hard work and teach this to his tribesmen as well. He thereafter lived as a devout disciple of Guru Nanak.

L 93.3
DESCRIPTION
Two thin sheets of gold are in shape of breast plate of armor. As these are made of gold it must be part of a ceremonial armor. The designs include circular die -marks which are typically Roman. The border is flat with pierced holes at intervals which were probable for fixing the gold sheets to the main armor.
Scholars name this type of Roman armor as Lorica Segmentata or Lorica Lamminata as the Romans called the metal sheets as lamina. Several Roman relief sculptures of 1st and 2nd century depict soldiers wearing this kind of plate armor.
These armor pieces were discovered while digging top of mound in village Bhadavali near Kamshet in Pune district. These finds are another clue of India’s trade with the Roman Empire in the 1st -2nd centuries. Junnar in Pune along with Paithan in Aurangabad and Ter in Osmanabad district were important seats of power in Maharashtra of the Satavahana rulers who had flourishing trade with the Roman Empire. Excavations at these sites have revealed clayware, utensils, implements and ornaments of Roman origin.

Ragini Kakubha,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/43.20.jpg,"Ragini Kakubha
43.20
DESCRIPTION
Indian classical music system based on ragas and Ragini’s or melodies is one of the most creative inventions. According to the classification of Mesakarna , a renowned musicologist of the early 16th century, there are 6 main ragas 30 raginis, and 48 ragaputras (sons). Each raga expresses or evokes a particular mood and is related to a specific season and time.
This is a pictorial depiction of Ragini Kakubha. Ragini Kakubha is the wife of Raga Megha. This melody conveys the mood of a dejected heroine who is been separated from her lover and is wandering in viraha in the jungle. A pair of peacocks give her company in her solitude. The plaintive cries of the peacocks enhance the pain of dejection and convey her status more effectively.
Ragamala of garland of melody depicts different moods, and ethos created by the musical notes of that particular Ragini. This is pictorially expressed in miniature paintings based on poetic expressions.
Set against a rocky landscape the painting here depicts Ragini Kakubha. The Ragini in the form of a beautiful maiden is sitting on a small hillock holding the Rudra veena. She is very lovingly feeding the charming peacocks with colourful plumes. A pond in the foreground is filled with lotuses and geese. In the background, a group of dears is very curiously peeping out from behind an architectural structure. A cluster of grayish clouds adds beauty to the whole painting.
Ragini Kakubha is the wife of Raga Megha. This melody conveys the mood of a dejected heroine who is been separated from her lover and is wondering in viraha in the jungle. A pair of peacock gives her company in her solitude. The plaintive dries of the peopcocks enhances the pain of dejection and conveys her status more effectively.
Ragamala of garland of melody depicts different moods, and ethos created by the musical notes of that particular ragini. This is pictorially expressed with the miniature paintings based on the poetic expressions.
Kakubha Ragini, a wife of Megha Raga, has the mood of a heroine deserted by her lover. Holding two lotus flower garlands, Kakubha wanders sadly in a grove with two peacocks, whose plaintive cries would have been understood as echoing her feelings of dejection.
Raga (Sanskrit, color or passion) is the term for a classical music mode, a set framework for improvisation. Having originated in the first millennium, ragas were systematized and classified during the thirteenth through sixteenth century, they were classified into ragamalas, meaning garlands of musical modes. A common system recognized six raga husbands, each ""married"" to five ragini wives for a total of thirty-six ""families."" Families of musical modes sometimes included sons or ragaputras as well. By the fifteenth century, ragas had become associated with specific moods, times, seasons, affective properties, deities, lovers, and heroes. Around 1590-1620, illustrated ragamala series became a favorite subject for Rajput patrons, as well as for some Mughals, such as Abdur Rahim, patron of the Freer Ramayana and the Laud Ragamala. Specific iconographies were developed for depicting each mode. These formulae lent themselves to variations, which were sometimes dependent on region.
Illustrated ragas evoke mood and engender feeling, as do musical compositions. But the connection seems to be indirect. Although some connoisseurs of music may have internally ""heard"" a composition when viewing its image, ragamalas were probably more broadly valued for their poetic and pictorial pleasures. The commission of a ragamala series would also have been understood as a sign of a patron's cultivated sensibility.

DESCRIPTION
Obverse of Folio 31 from the illustrated manuscript of Devi Mahatmya
The Devi Mahatmya of Markandeya Purana is probably the most popular text copied and illustrated in all parts of India for religious merit as well as for reading and recitation. It contains the myth of the destruction of the all-powerful demon Mahisha and his retinue, by goddess Durga, the embodiment of the energies of all the gods. The goddess takes various forms from fearsome to benign to kill the demons.
The wooden covers of this manuscript record the names of some of the family members of Atmaram Bhukanvala, an old affluent family of Surat. It is likely that the manuscript once belonged to the family.
The text describes the battle between Devi and demon Chanda and Munda. According to the description when demon Chand and Munda tried to injure the Goddess with thousands of arrows and discs, Goddess Kali, showing her terrifying form, laughed loudly, grabbed demon Chanda’s head by his hair and killed him with her powerful sword.
The folio illustrates dashabhuja (ten-armed) goddess bearing different weapons, riding on lion. She is holding the head of demon Chanda in her one hand.

Portrait of Shah Abbas II of Persia (1642-1667),https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/15.224.jpg,"Portrait of Shah Abbas II of Persia (1642-1667)
15.224
DESCRIPTION
This is an equestrian portrait of the Shah Abbas II of Persia with the hawk resting on his fist as a symbol of sovereignty. The Persians consider dogs impure and therefore employ birds for hunting purposes.
Shah Abbas II was the seventh Shah of Safavid Iran. He lived a very affluent lifestyle and also maintained a royal atelier. He gave patronage to both Iranian and Dutch painters and encouraged Iranian painters to learn the European painting style. He had diplomatic relations with the Mughals and Qandhahar was the primary point of conflict between them.
The present painting seems to be a Mughal copy of an Iranian painting. Nils Mattsson Kioping, a swede traveler who visited Iran at the time of Shah Abbas II writes “ For hunting, he (Shah Abbas II) uses falcons, among which is a white raven with a red beak, which is as swift in striking birds as the falcon. He also has two hundred leopards that have been trained so that no game in the fields or forests can pass them by without their catching it in three leaps…..In his state where the royal horses are fed, and which are one hundred in numbers, there is exceptional cleanliness…They are covered with the finest golden cloth and their vessels are of fine Arabian gold.” (Travelogue and autobiography 1647-1657, Nils Mattssons Kioping, KVHAA handlingar historiska series 39, pp 77-78).
Falconry or hawking, a form of hunting was a popular sport amongst Kings and noblemen in medieval times. This form of hunting was viewed more as a means of entertainment. Falconers raised the young birds usually falcons, hawks, and eagles, and trained them to hunt small birds and animals like partridges, cranes, and hares.
Artists drew and painted many varieties of falcon portraits during the times of Jahangir (r. 1605- 27). Mughal emperors had a separate department for the royal hawk and the employees. The baz namas are treatises or books that contain detailed chapters on ways to keep the hawks healthy and treat their diseases.
Before the turn of the 16th century, Iran went through a devastating period due to Turkish and Mongol invasions. The peaceful rule of the Safavid dynasty (1499-1736) brought about the revival of the passion for hawking and hunting.

DESCRIPTION
In the early 19th century Punjab, during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh the artists were greatly patronized. The state of Patiala and Kapurthala also gave similar patronage. Apart from royal patronage, another source of encouragement came from the British officers who were employed in the East India Company or in the royal courts. They commissioned artists to portray and record the cultural diversity of India. The arrival of the British and Europeans already opened up new avenues for indigenous artists to learn and adopt the techniques of western art. This led to the emergence of a new genre of style which included very interesting and informative documentation of everyday life, professions, and characters.
These sketches of ordinary folk brought a new world of everyday people, craft, and professions which was not commonly seen in the court art of India. Kehar Singh and Kapur Singh were the two very sensitive artists of this time who captured the minute details with sensitivity and warmth. Kapur Singh went to the court of Lahore in search of patronage. During the course, he got exposed to the European watercolor technique and accuracy when the Sikh rule was replaced by British rule. Many of their sketches made by him are scattered around the collection of Museums. The one published here presents a detailed depiction of a traditional goldsmith. The lines of experience stretched on his face, the acute professional concentration, and the details of essential paraphernalia are very faithfully recorded by the artist. He mentioned the name of the person in takari on the left corner of the sketch.

DESCRIPTION
There is hardly any being, historical or mythological who has so completely pervaded the cultural life of India, as has Krishna the blue God. This is evident not only from the inexhaustible literature on Krishna bhakti but even from the equally infinite canvas of art. Royal princes of Rajasthan and the hilly region adopted the Bhagavata dharma which circles around Krishna and elevated it to the status of Rajadharma or religion of the state. The Rajpoot kings under the influence of Pushti Marga celebrated Krishna through various aesthetic representations such as painting, storytelling, song, and dance.
The present painting is an interesting example of this where Krishna is playing the traditional game of fugadi with his beloved Radha. The beauty of Krishna is that he becomes one with his devotee and through his leelas mesmerizes and engages them intensely.

DESCRIPTION
The painting is laid in a courtyard of a house and depicts a very unusual subject where a priest is performing a ritual of exorcism on a lady in the presence of people of the household and surrounding area. In the process of driving away the devil which they believe has possessed the body of the female, they are performing all sorts of torture and gory rituals. Exorcism or the ritualistic act of driving out evil spirits is a special type of faith healing.
Exorcism has a long history in various cultures around the world. This 18th-century painting raises a very crucial issue of superstitions and the status of mental health in rural society. Even after the gap of 200 years after the creation of this painting and the progress in education, science, and health care this evil is still present in some pockets of India. In many of rural areas, diseases like epilepsy, depression, or mental disorder are seen as the cause of possession by evil spirits and are treated with the help of priests. The victims are more often females.
A few of the possible reasons for this misconception could be the fear of social stigma, a lack of awareness, gender bias, the high cost of treatment, and a strong belief in good or bad spirits which stops people to take appropriate medical help or concealing.

DESCRIPTION
Dance, drama, and music form an essential part of the Bhagavata sect since ancient times. There is a mention in the Bhagavata Purana where Krishna says “ My stories should be sung, danced and enacted on festive occasions”. (XI. 27.44).
Philosophically the most important dance of Krishna is Rasamandala (Raas Lila), meaning circle of delight or ecstasy. The love of gopis and Krishna takes place in a circle that has neither beginning nor an end and goes on and on for eternity. During the dance, Krishna multiplies himself and dances with all the gopis simultaneously. He thus convinces them that he participates in their lives, giving freely of himself to each and everyone and ensuring that he is lovingly and completely available to his devotees. The dance leads the gopis to the path of liberation where the individual soul (Jivatman) joins the divine soul (Patmatman).
The present painting depicts the Rasa Leela where Radha and Krishna are shown seated on a full-bloomed lotus in the centre. Krishna is playing the flute and Radha is holding a pink lotus in her hand. They are encircled by Krishna and gopis playing rasa. Krishna has manifested himself in many forms so as to accompany each gopi. At the top, celestial deities in three vimanas (airplanes) are showering flowers on them.

Rishabhanatha left his kingdom to his son Bharata who in order to be on Chakravarti, entered into a duel with his brother Bahubali. As the name suggests Bahubali was a strong man, he lifted Bharata and flung him down twice. As he was going to do the same the third time, wisdom overpowered him and he realised the futility of the worldly power. He gently put down his brother and went to the forest to practice austerities to attain Kevlar Gyana (omniscience).
He performed such severe penance that he was surrounded by ant - hills and creepers wound around his legs and spread all over his body.
The depictions of Bahubali in sculptures and paintings show him in standing posture with creepers spread on his body. The 65 feet high Bahubali or Gomateshwara sculpture at Shravanabelagola in Karnataka is an excellent example of this. In present painting also he is depicted in same posture which is known as Kayotsarga pose with creepers spread on his body.

Krishna’s Rasakrida in the Yamuna,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2009.93.jpg,"Krishna’s Rasakrida in the Yamuna
2009.93
DESCRIPTION
There have been many paintings of the Rasalila of Krishna, but the scene where gopis sprinkled the water of the Yamuna on Krishna is rarely illustrated in the Bhagavata Purana manuscripts. It is described in the Bhagavata Purana X, 33, 24-40 how, during the Rasalila, Krishna entered the waters of the Yamuna, and “sported here like a king elephant as he was profusely sprinkled over with water on all sides by the youthful damsels who were casting amorous glances at him and were laughing heartily while he was being praised by the gods who were showering on him flowers from their aerial cars”. Later at Brahma muhurta (early morning), the gopis reluctantly returned home.
This folio of a Bhagavata Purana manuscript elaborately painted at Nagpur illustrates the episode. It is a full moon night in Vrindavan, the trees are in full bloom, and the clear blue waters of the Yamuna in the foreground are full of pink
lotuses. The Blue God, dressed as usual in his pitambara with a golden border, a long white vanamala, and a morapichha in his mukuta, is encircled by the gopis dressed in colourful garments. All of them are standing partially submerged in the river. They spray water at Krishna in delightful amorous sport. The blue water turns into tiny white drops as it splashes against Krishna. In return, he also throws water on the faces of two gopis. The four gopis standing on the bank behind the trees seem to be looking for Krishna or are returning home.
The manuscript in long horizontal format is important for an understanding of the Nagpur style of painting. It seems that there were two identical manuscripts of the Bhagavata Purana commissioned probably for the two Bhosla brothers.1 It is
interesting that one, a few folios of which are in the Museum collection, is made of Indian handmade paper, while the folios of the other have watermarks on the paper which must have been imported from the West. This folio bears a watermark, and due to the smoother surface, the quality of workmanship and colour differ to some extent from those done on Indian handmade paper. Verses 39 and 40 of the Bhagavata Purana X, 33 are inscribed to the left of the painting.

The textile is a part of an exhibition and project titled ‘Resurgence: Stories of an Earthquake, Survival and Art’. It was conceived by artist and curator Carole Douglas for the re-establishment of the textile traditions in Kutch after the devastation caused by the earthquake on 26th January 2001.
Gift of Pheroza Godrej
'My region was like a rose before the earthquake. Then something happened inside the earth and the pressure came up through the roots and stem and into the petals. It disturbed the rose. In the very centre Kutch was celebrating Jan. 26th' our Republic Day and holiday, when the earthquake happened. We were all deeply afraid. The fear spread. The noise was the worst. It was like war and explosions.
Everything was disturbed by this - mosques, temples and houses. All life was affected. People wept because such helplessness was everywhere. Such destruction never seen before in my life time.
In the old city of Bhuj, where my family was living, there was too much damage and still two years later no government help has come. People stayed outside the towns and villages. They slept in the open in the cold nights. It was winter. Some are still in temporary shelters without facility of light and water. They see no good future for themselves. We have moved to a house in Mandvi. I like being close to the sea, the air is good, but the main market for my work is in Bhuj, the business centre.
My work is about the disturbance. My whole family helped to design it. We all had many stories to tell of what we saw and felt. My brother Kasam helped with the work and I have put his initial with mine when I signed the work. At first, we were nervous making the piece. Now we are proud that people in Kutch like it so much and it will be seen in Australia.'

Figure of Thagyamin,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/33.480_01.jpg,"Figure of Thagyamin
33.480
DESCRIPTION
The figure is likely the deity Thagyamin (Burmese), or Sakka in the Pali canon, identified with Indra, the chief of the gods in the Vedic pantheon. While Indra’s role diminished in classical Hinduism, he held an important place in Buddhism, as head of the Buddhist deities residing on Mount Meru in the Heaven of the Thirty-three Gods and also as chief of the indigenous spirits, or nats, often classed together as the Thirty-seven Lords. He is generally shown standing, holding in one hand his three- or four-sided sword, and dressed as a Burmese king during the Konbaung period (1752–1885). In some depictions, he holds a tablet and a pen or stylus, emblematic of his role as one who records rights and wrongs accumulated through life and rewards or punishes individuals accordingly. Sakka appears in the early Buddhist murals of Pagan, usually holding a conch, another of his major attributes. At the famous Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, life-size figures of Thagyamin surround the base of the pagoda. Thagyamin is often paired in art with Brahma, another deity dear to the Pali pantheon. Both deities accompanied the Buddha from the Heaven of the Thirty-three Gods after the Buddha had instructed his mother on key Buddhist principles.

DESCRIPTION
This type of lamp is popular throughout India. If consist of an elegantly attired woman who connotes the goddess Lakshmi with a lamp in her hands. Dipa Lakshmi is generally shown standing on a lotus or elephant. In some part of India there is practice of gifting Dipa Lakshmi on elephant to newly wed daughters at festival time to bestow prosperity and fertility on her.
One of the most important milestones in the history of mankind is the discovery of fire. It has played a very crucial role in the progress and development of man and therefore, in India, fire and lamps are considered very auspicious.
In earlier times, lamps were perhaps only wicks lit in hollows or shallow depressions in stone. Later on, lamps were made of sea shells, clay and various metals like brass, copper and silver. In the ‘Ramayana’ and the ‘Mahabharata’ there are references to lamps made of gold. The earliest lamp was simple - a small bowl made of clay with a beak-like projection, popularly known as Panti. Interestingly, this type of lamp is found in India as early as the Harappan period (3300 BCE to 1800 BCE) and continues till this date!
In India, lamp symbolizes the human body and flame symbolizes the soul. Thus the individual is a Deepak (lamp) and the soul is a jeevan jyoti (the flame of life). Indians believe, that the soul is immortal. Even after the death of a person, a lamp is lit to guide the departing soul into the other world.
At every stage of life therefore, lamps are lit to celebrate the eternal life force. In earlier times special lamps were lit at coronation ceremonies, on the return of a victorious warrior and at every other important occasion. The aarti (ritualistic adoration with lighted lamps) is performed even today to strengthen and establish relationship between man and God, brother and sister, wife and husband, mother and child. Ancient texts mention Deepadaan (gifting of lamp) as a act of high merit. There are several festivals connected with lamps – Deep Amavasya (July – August), Diwali (October – November) and Ganga poojan which are celebrated with great pomp.
With the passage of time there has been innovation in the types and shapes of lamps meant for different occasions and requirement.

DESCRIPTION
This terracotta head is probably that of a dancer. Notice the exotic jewellery! Her elaborate hairdo is adorned with beautiful hair ornaments with Makarika (crocodile) decoration. These Makarikas hold a circular floral ornament, resting on her forehead in between the bands of her curly hair. Behind this is another ornamental band over an attractive coiffure.
The face is a combination of the Gandhara and Gupta styles. Observe the large bow-like eyebrows, the elegant nose, and the full, sensuous lips. The head is stylishly bent in a slight profile highlighting the beauty of her face.
The use of animal heads as a decorative element in ornamental jewellery was a Graeco-Roman influence on Indian art.
Akhnoor, the place where this terracotta was found has yielded a large number of terracotta figures of this period. They are highly influenced in style by that of Graeco-Roman sculptures of the same period.

A carved brick depicting an amorous couple (Mithuna)
The pair of male and female in Indian art has a much wider connotation than lust as sexual or procreative partners. They are also partners in religious duties such as the performance of important ceremonies and rituals to acquire religious merit. In fact, no Grihya and other sacrifices could be performed by a single man, as it was considered, incomplete. Yugala or Mithuna symbolised completeness or totality of life and therefore is considered auspicious. The presence of Mithuna sculptures on Indian temples reflects the partnership of man and woman both in the act of dharma and karma. This concept is emphatically expressed even in the Rig veda wherein it is stated: ""they accompanied by their wives, worshipped the fire who is worthy of worship."" The Dharmashastras also enjoin that from the time of marriage the husband and wife work together for the ultimate fulfilment of life.

Escaping Elephant,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/55.96.jpg,"Escaping Elephant

DESCRIPTION
This painting is a graphic study of the elephants; their taut muscles curving and folding over each other with their forceful movements and their legs striding widely, in an attempt to escape. The elephant who has broken off all the four chains is running ahead and is being driven into an arched entrance probably that of a tent with the help of the tamed one following behind. The attendants hold burning sticks, known as charkhi to frighten the animal.
The inscription on the top left corner mentions that the elephants Bhalerao and Anup belong to Rao Surjan (1554–1583 CE). Various contours of the elephant are effectively rendered with masterly brushwork and shading against the background of the plain paper. It is tinted in places and was probably intended to be partially painted, particularly in the costumes of the human figures. The painting is obviously not contemporary. The study of elephants in different actions was done by the Bundi artist as early as the 17th century, evidence of which still survives at the Badal Mahal murals at Bundi.

DESCRIPTION
The brick, within a single panel, depicts one of Buddha's twelve exemplary deeds, that is, his birth in the Lumbini forest. Queen Mayadevi, Shakyamuni's mother, can be observed standing while holding a branch with her right hand. To her right is a row of attendants receiving the infant, the future Buddha, emerging from her side. The attendants can be seen wearing a cap-like headdress and single-stranded necklaces, while Mayadevi herself can be seen wearing a crown, a necklace, armbands, and wristbands. The Altdanakatha elaborates on the tale behind this object. While travelling back to her parent's palace to give birth, in keeping with the custom, Mayadevi was struck by the beauty of the Lumbini forest. Standing amidst the trees, she held a branch, and at that moment began experiencing labour pains, with the future Buddha being born soon after. There have been many conjectures aiming to explain Mayadevi's pose.

DESCRIPTION
This roundel of Kubera, the God of wealth and also the guardian of the western (north) direction was placed on the west wall of the stupa, which was probably the front side of the monument. Pot-bellied Kubera is seated in the midst of acanthus leaves, a style peculiar to the Mirpur Khas artist. The curves of the leaves gracefully blend and harmonise with the folds of his garments. He wears a three-peaked tiara, necklace, big earrings, a kamarabandha and armlets and holds a singular emblem of the lotus in his hand. His hair falls in neatly organised tassels right below his shoulders. He is seated in the Ardhaparyankasana slightly leaning to his right aligning with the curve of the roundel. The image is important as one of the early representations of Kubera. Besides being auspicious. The roundel must have also served as a decorative piece on the outer wall of the stupa.

These bricks vary in size, measuring between 6 to 18 inches in length. The variety of their patterns is infinite, suitable for the embellishment of different parts of the architecture. The extant site gives a fairly good idea of the original arrangement of the bricks on the stupa.

DESCRIPTION
The use of matchlocks required barutdan or gunpowder flasks. They were made in a variety of materials and in innovative shapes as can be seen here. Instead of an ordinary container for carrying the gunpowder at the time of the hunt, the craftsman has used a naturally hollow elephant tusk. The curve of the tusk is imaginatively employed to give it the form of a leaping antelope. Devoid of any unnecessary decoration, the antelope is depicted as if leaping, lips slightly parted, and eyes wide open with anxiety.
There are some traces of paint in the ears, lips, and eyes. The stopper, made of iron, is designed to match the rhythm of the piece. The fashion of using ivory barutdan carved in some animal or composite form must have been popular, as is evident from the availability of other similar pieces, some of which are highly decorative.

Ewer with Peacock and Peonies,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/33.1331_01.jpg,"Ewer with Peacock and Peonies
33.1331
DESCRIPTION
The ewer with gold decoration on enamel is a very rare piece and can be regarded as one of the treasures of the Tata Collection. This combination was an innovation of the early 16th century. The gold motifs are the dominant design, with the enamelled body forming the background, resulting in a gorgeous and striking piece. In Japan, this type of porcelain is known as kinrande or “gold brocade” ware and is highly appreciated.
This type of vase, possibly a wine pot, can be traced back to the ewers of the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). By the early 16th century, the shape had taken on delicate lines, giving it an elegant profile. The handle is provided with a loop after a metal prototype, so that the lid, now lost, could be chained to the handle. The slender spout is connected to the body by a graceful S-shaped cloud pattern. The heart-shaped panel decorating the body bears a peacock among peonies, a Song dynasty motif meaning “to civilize the world” and on the neck are banana leaves. Flowers in full bloom, scrolling leaves, and some of the Eight Treasures decorate the rest of the piece. The base is covered with white glaze and bears a square seal in blue-underglaze.

DESCRIPTION
The box bagged a gold medal for wood carving in the Indian Art Exhibition at Delhi, 1903. It was made by Mistris Shapur Subbrayappa and Sagar Dodda Puttappa, and carvers Ganapati Kesavappa, M. Puttappa, and Veerappa of Mysore. The art of sandalwood carving in the Shimoga district of Mysore was practised by a community known as Gudigars. They were supposed to have migrated from Goa during the Portuguese occupation. The Gudigar community owes its name to the fact that they were originally the hereditary carvers and painters of the temples (gudi).
L. Rice, who made a survey of this craft, states, “The material is hard and minuteness of the work demands the utmost care and patience…. The artists are said to lose their eyesight at an early age.” Sandalwood lends itself to very intricate and fine carving because of its close grain and tough structure. The box is so minutely carved that not even the tiniest portion of its surface is left untouched. It is supported on four elephant-figure legs. The interior of the box is equally intricately carved.
The craftsmanship clearly indicates the influence of Chinese carvings, particularly in the depiction of landscapes, trees, and mountains. The border patterns are charming examples of Chalukyan-style ornamentation.

DESCRIPTION
With the invasion of Alexander in 326 BCE, the Gandhara region got peopled by the Greeks. In the Parthians and other settlers were converted to the prevalent Buddhist way of life. The art form we call Gandhara resulted. It flourished from the 2nd to 4th century CE.
The image of the Bodhisattva in Buddhism was introduced for the first time in Gandhara art. As you can see in this stucco, the head is fashioned after the Graeco-Roman ideals of anatomical perfection.
This Bodhisattva head has a princely charm. The features are well-defined: beautiful eyelids and deep eye sockets under elegantly curved eyebrows, an aquiline nose, a broad forehead, thin lips, and a tuft on his head denoting wisdom. The light beige earth colour, the texture of the material, and the naturalistic modelling of the face make it almost human.
Like stone, stucco was a popular medium in Gandhara from at least the 1st century though along with clay it became more popular in the 4th–5th century.

Ragini Todi,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2009.307.jpg,"Ragini Todi
2009.307
DESCRIPTION
Artist: Nisaruddin
Ragini Todi is one of the most beautiful folios of the famous Chavand Ragamala dated 1605. The heroine holding a vina is proceeding somewhere and turns to look back at the two blackbuck fawns following her, gently coaxing them to return home.
Generally, Ragini Todi is described as a lady attracting deer. A careful study of the painting makes it obvious that the lady is walking away while the fawns follow her. The imagery is reminiscent of the famous scene from Abhijnana Shakuntala where a fawn follows Shakuntala who, on taking leave of the members of the hermitage of Kanva, proceeds towards the kingdom of Bharata. She feeds the tiny one fresh shoots of grass and coaxes it to return. Sangita Damodara, one of the earliest treatises on the iconography of the ragas, datable to the 15th century, visualizes Ragini Todi in a similar manner:
Standing near a dense forest, fondling the deer with the shoots of lotus,

with beautiful eyes like half-blown lotus, possessing the complexion of a

lotus garland, she is the Ragini Todi.
The term todi connotes parting or breaking in Persian. Traditionally Ragini Todi is also considered to evoke sad feelings. The pain of parting with the daughter after her marriage, so poignantly described by Kalidasa, is an unforgettable experience for every parent. It is possible that musicologists derived the iconography of this raga from this description of Kalidasa. The melody itself may have developed from the songs which are sung at the time of bidding the daughter goodbye. Even today, these songs form a part of the wedding ritual of almost every community in India.
The date of the painting was read by Khandalavala himself in the colophon of the set which is now in the Gopikrishna Kanoria collection.

22.3225 (332 folio)
DESCRIPTION
Sir Ratan Tata Art Collection.
Script – Nastaliq,
language – Persian.
The Khamsa-i-Nizami is a masnavi (collection of poems) by poet Nizami. A famous classic of Persian literature, it consists of five poems: Makhnul Asarar (not dated), Khusru-wa Shirin (1584 CE), Haft Paikar (1584 CE), Laila Majnu (1583 CE), and Sikandar Nama (not dated). Among these, only Haft Paikar is extensively illustrated.
Haft Paikar is the story of Prince Behram, the son of Yazdegar, King of Persia. He was an expert in the game of hunting and achieved the title Gur – wild ass – after killing a fighting lion and wild ass with one arrow. Later he married seven beautiful princesses from different countries. He then ordered his most talented architect Shideh to build a palace for each of the seven princesses. Shideh, true to his abilities, built seven palaces with different coloured domes constructed according to the positions of the planets and their respective colours. Behram decided to visit the princesses one by one according to the day of the week, and requested each of them to tell him a story.
The seven stories told by seven princesses reflect seven different stages in the philosophical journey of human life. Behram first visits the princess in the black pavilion, which symbolizes the mystery of God hidden by the veil of ignorance. His journey ends at the palace of Princess Diroste,. which is white, a symbol of divine purity and unity.
The colophon pages of the manuscript do not mention the name of the scribe. However, the notes in Persian before the beginning of the second and third masnavi give information about the owner of the book in a later period. It seems that in the mid-17th century this book was in the possession of a Mughal noble who took it with him on the expedition to Kandahar led by Prince Muhammad Aurangzeb. The study of these notes yields very interesting information about the movements of the royal army and the distances covered.

S 110
DESCRIPTION
The Shalabhanjika is a common decorative motif generously depicted in Indian stupa and temple architecture. Common to Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist architecture they are mainly designed as bracket figures.
They are often depicted as a well-adorned lady standing gracefully under a stylised tree or grasping the branch of a tree. She may also be shown engaged in different activities like dancing, playing a musical instrument, or adorning herself with cosmetics and jewellery. They are known as Madanikas, Surasundaris, or Devanganas in ancient and medieval Indian Shilpa texts. These celestial beauties were all-time favourites of Sanskrit and Prakrit poets and playwriters. Often their nayikas (heroines) were associated with these themes; for e.g., Rajasekhara's 'Viddhashalabhanjika' and 'Karpuramanjari'
They are symbols of fertility and nourishment which can be deduced upon observing the efforts taken to carve their hips and breasts. The Yakshi (tree nymph) sculptures may be considered a prototype for them.
Here, a well adorned young lady stands under stylised tree in full bloom. Her sharp features are finely delineated; particularly interesting are her arched eyebrows and firm yet delicate chin. Her nose must have been well shaped once. She is shown standing cross-legged, in tribhanga pose. Holding a mirror in her left hand she is adorning her hair with her right hand. She looks engrossed in her thoughts. What is she thinking? Well, that's left to your imagination!

Copy of Portland Vase,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/January-2021-e1654256940304.jpg,"Copy of Portland Vase
33.1036
DESCRIPTION
The Portland Vase, a delicately carved Roman cameo glass vessel of deepest cobalt blue covered with opaque milky-white glass, was probably made about the time of the birth of Christ, during the reign of Augustus (27 BCE - 14 CE), in Rome. It is one of the most celebrated of all antiquities. It is not entirely in its original form and was almost certainly made as an amphora with a pointed base, probably broken in antiquity and repaired with an unrelated cameo disc. The subject of the reliefs has never been definitively explained and many interpretations have been proposed.
Its fame in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, is due to the brilliant series of copies made in black jasper ware by Josiah Wedgwood (1730–95) after he was lent the original by the 3rd Duke of Portland in 1786. Wedgwood was one of the most innovative figures in the history of English ceramics. His many experiments with different kinds of bodies and glazes led to the perfection, around 1771, of a high-fired stoneware which he called “Jasper”. This was the material used for his Portland Vase copies. The subtlety of the original reliefs proved difficult to replicate, however, and the first successful copies date from 1789. The Wedgwood Company produced many copies of the vase and dating this one is not easy. It must date from before 1860, however, when the factory introduced a three-letter dating system. The inclusion of the Paris cameo under the base may suggest a date before 1845 when the British Museum detached it from the body and displayed it separately.

The Devi Mahatmya of the Markandeya Purana (Adhyaya 81-93) is probably the most popular text copied and illustrated in almost all parts of India for religious merit as well as for reading and recitation. It contains the myth of the destruction of the all-powerful demon Mahisha and his retinue, by goddess Durga, the embodiment of the energies of all the gods.

Instead of a single swan as her mount, the artist has engaged a pair to draw her chariot. The Devanagari inscription on top reads as “Bhavani”.

DESCRIPTION
Though depicting somewhat stiff and stunted human figures, the painting is lively with colour and movement. The gopas have come to the forest and are seated, covered with a blanket, near a fast-flowing rivulet or probably the river Yamuna which bends sharply at the left. Cows and calves of variegated colours have also drawn near to drink water. The westerly monsoon wind is blowing, bending the trees to the right. Krishna, standing under a tree, covers Radha with his kari kamari, the black blanket usually carried by cowherds. On the other side, a bed of leaves is prepared for them in a beautifully decorated arched pavilion and he is seen again in the centre, leading Radha to it. His black blanket is blowing about with the wind and can hardly protect them.
Dressed in bright yellow and orange attire, Krishna and Radha are set against the dark brown background typical of the Mewar school. Rain clouds have gathered in the sky, brightened by lightning which appears like golden snakes. The text of the inscription above the painting is probably from a composition by one of the saint poets of the Vallabhacharya sect.

DESCRIPTION
This sculpture from a stupa at Nagapattinam provides important artistic evidence of Chinese and Southeast Asian connections with India. An inscription records that a Chinese king constructed a stupa for Chinese traders, who arrived here during the reign of the Pallava king, Narsimavarman II (690–720 CE). Marco Polo observed this inscription in the 13th century. Though the characteristics of the Buddha standing on a double-inverted lotus are familiar, the rendering reveals foreign influences. The most remarkable feature is the flame-like ushnisha above the hair. Variations in the depiction of both hands, raised in the abhaya and the chintana mudra near the waist, are a distinct Southeast Asian feature. The image was probably gilded. The artist could have been Indian or Javanese.

90.7/4
DESCRIPTION
Saura-Pitha is one of the unique sculptures which does not depict a divinity or a decorative figure. Saura-Pitha in fact symbolises astronomical concepts expressed through religious imagery. The rising and setting of the sun provided directions and its revolution through various radical signs determined the time of the day. Both the correct direction and the right direction were computed by drawing a circle on a plain ground with gnomon fixed in the centre of the circle. The shadow of the gnomon would move proportionately with the movement of the sun and would, therefore, indicate the time.
This sculpture or pitha is divided into three levels: a square base, an octagonal structure in the middle and above it is a circular panel having a carved circle or chart made of lotus petals, symbolising the sun. The top circle has sixteen equidistant segments pointing to sixteen directions. Around the circle are carved the figures of the twelve constellations through which the sun makes his sojourn in one complete day of twenty-four hours.

DESCRIPTION
Ruyi means ‘as you wish’. During the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), many such wish-granting sceptres were made as presents for the emperors, empresses, and for courtiers of high rank. They were presented on special occasions such as birthdays and weddings.
Although the sceptres that are in the shape of a sacred fungus (lingzhi) symbolizing immortality are themselves auspicious objects, the Chinese further embellished them with auspicious symbols and motifs of blessings. By decoding the symbols on the sceptre, one could understand the occasion for which it was made. The Ruyi was created in many mediums such as cast gold or silver, semi-precious stones like jade and nephrite, wood and lacquer.
This sceptre has a landscape with Shoulao, the God of longevity with an attendant. He is holding a branch of a peach tree symbolising longevity. The handle is carved with the fungus of immortality, peach tree, bamboo, and narcissus representing the phrase “the heavenly immortals bring birthday greetings”. The sceptre has yellow tassels which show that it came originally from the Qing Palace where yellow is the imperial colour. It is encased in a beautiful wooden box.

DESCRIPTION
Series: Fifty-Three Posting Stations of Tōkaidō
The Tōkaidō highway (Eastern Sea Route) between Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo), built-in early times, rose to prominence at the beginning of the 17th century CE with the selection of Edo as the military capital of Japan. This highway is divided into 53 convenient stages of rest steps, with inns and restaurants at each. In 1832, Hiroshige was invited to join an embassy of officials to the imperial court. The resulting series of prints Tōkaidō gojūsan-tsugi [Fifty-Three Posting Stations of Tōkaidō]; a product of his sketching of the journey, was extremely successful and led to the firm establishment of his artistic reputation. The set of 55 prints (the 53 stations plus the cities of Edo and Kyoto at either end of the highway) in their unique combination of romance and realism, set a new trend in Japanese prints. This series paved the way for the depiction of the whole range of Japan’s scenic beauties in a manner that the common person could readily appreciate. When Europe rediscovered Japanese print at the end of the 19th century, Hiroshige gave Western artists such as Cezanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaugin, and Van Gogh a new vision of nature.

DESCRIPTION
A copy of Qajar armour with figures.
When the personal belongings of Tipu Sultan found their way to London after his death in 1799, Indian art, especially arms and armour found a new market, in Europe. Personal items belonging to Emperors and Kings were in high demand in the 19th century West. This brought a new opportunity to the Indian craftsmen who were skilled at replicating anything and everything. This shield is a high-quality production and copy of a Qajar (1794-1925, Iran) work.
A war scene is depicted on the shield. There are exhibits of similar make - a helmet with chain of mail neck guard and arm guards - in the CSMVS collection. These were probably made in Lahore, which was not just an important political city but also a distinguished centre producing arms and armour.

DESCRIPTION
In Indian textile tradition, pashmina shawls from Kashmir hold a pride place. They were made of wool from a special breed of goat called pashm. A single shawl was a result of the collective efforts of spinners, dyers, designers, weavers, and embroiders. The designs are composed of buta, badami (almond), ambi or kairi (paisely), meander and flora, khat-rast (stripes), and shikargah (hunting) motifs. The craft of making the woollen shawls received immense patronage from Mughal emperors. As mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari, Emperor Akbar gave these shawls the name param naram meaning very soft. It was a special prerogative of the royal to wear such shawls. Others could wear it only if it was presented by the ruler or permitted by him. In the 17th and the 18th centuries, both embroidered and woven shawls from Kashmir were in great demand by the Europeans and by affluent families in India. In the 20th century, Parsis considered these shawls at the time of weddings in particular. Apart from shawls, doshalas (shoulder mantle), patkas (sash or kamarbandha), rumals (square shawls), jamewars (garment piece to stitch jama) were also made.

DESCRIPTION
Miniature paintings on transparent sheets of mica were popular in India in the 19th Century as they were sold to British tourists as souvenirs. Known for their intense colours and delicate forms, mica paintings hold an intrinsic heritage value. These paintings were made by Indian painters, to suit the demands of the British in an Indo-European style. As the paintings were mainly commissioned by the British Company officials, they are known as Company School paintings.
Mica is a transparent material made of potassium silicates, found in South India as well as in parts of Bihar. As a painting medium, the thin sheets of mica are painted using gouache. Its smooth structure does not let the paint sink in and the colours applied to it appear exceptionally bright. Due to the highly smooth surface of mica, it became essential for the artists to use a binding medium with the colours to create these works. In a few of the paintings, colour has been applied to both the front and the back surfaces of the sheet—to enhance the opacity of the pigment. This approach makes the paintings appear three-dimensional.

DESCRIPTION
Halloween is an annual holiday celebrated each year on October 31. It originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honour all saints - All Saints Day; which then incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning costumes, eating sweet treats and divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching horror films.
The Japanese have many wild and wonderful legends of ghostly beings, known as Yokai, and one of the most malevolent of them all is the Gashadokuro. The name literally translates to “starving skeleton”.

2009.13
DESCRIPTION
Folio from an illustrated manuscript of the Ramayana.
Ascribed to Nurpur by Archer; to Manaku of Guler by Goswamy.
This painting depicts a scene from the Kishkindha Kanda of the Ramayana, which is inscribed on the reverse. After the death of Vali, Rama and Lakshmana live on a hill for the duration of the rainy season before Sugriva can join them in the search for Sita. The rainy season gives way to autumnal breezes. It is described in the Ramayana: “Rama seated on a peak shining with minerals”.
Rama and Lakshmana are seated on a peak. Distressed at the thought of Sita, Rama addresses Lakshmana: “look, the chakravakas from the Manasa Lake, their bodies covered with the pollen of lotuses, and spreading their wings, they are resting on the banks of the river”. The full autumn moon in the clear blue sky, a large branch of the willow bent over the two birds between the two trees, half-open lotuses in the river, and the flat dark background, lend an unusual charm to this painting.

From a set of Baramasa
Jyestha is the third month of the Hindu calendar and is associated with the high summer.
Baramasa, the twelve months (Chaitra, Baisakha, Jyeshtha, Ashadha, Shravan, Bhadon, Ashvina, Kartika, Agahana, Pausha, Magh and Phalguna) of the Indian calendar found recognition in the poetry of many poets.
About Baramasa, there are 13 couplets (one doha and 12 chupai) mentioned in Keshavdasa’s Kavipriya. Keshavdasa starts Baramasa with the month of Chaitra and ends with the month of Phalguna. His poetry mirrors his mastery of the selection of words and phrases and describes the life, ceremonies, and rituals of the people in different seasons. This has been given visual life especially by the Rajasthani and Pahari painters – each month suggesting a different kind of mood or behaviour. It is a popular subject in Bundi school as it gives the artists an opportunity to indulge in their love for landscape.

In the middle, on the yellow background, an elephant is depicted with raised trunk, intoxicated eyes, and a curled tail, signs of anxiety. Agitated by the intolerable heat, the one behind the hillock seems to be rushing somewhere probably in search of water, and another is trying to climb a hillock. A scary monkey is on the top of the hillock while another is trying to take shelter on the bare tree on the left side. At the bottom, an elephant is shown enjoying the comforts of being in the cool waters of the lotus pond.
The artist has very effectively used the combination of orange and yellow to create an atmosphere of the burning summer of Rajasthan.

2009.121
DESCRIPTION
The theme of Shiva's family engaged in different activities was fairly popular with Pahari artists and several versions still exist. Shiva, with the crescent moon on his matted hair, and Parvati are busy preparing bhang, the favourite drink of Shiva. The three-headed Kartikeya, though young and well aware of the effects of the intoxicating drink, eagerly rushes to his mother to get his share in the bowls held in his hands, while Ganesha quietly steals the drink from the main container with his long trunk.
There were occasions when artists liked to thin of the great and terrible Shiva as a home-loving god, mindful of his devoted wife of the royal estate, who never wearied of tramping the mountains with him.
The Hill folk believe that on Mahashivratri, Shiva and his family can still be seen trekking through the mountains on their way to Mount Kailash.

22.4577
DESCRIPTION
Probably born in Milan, Marco d’Oggiono was associated with Leonardo da Vinci by the early 1490s and became one of his principals and most successful followers. He received important commissions in Milan, Venice and Liguria and died a wealthy man. In this large panel, Leonardo’s influence is most evident in the figural types and in their soft, or sfumato, or modelling. The composition echoes the master’s celebrated Madonna of the Rocks of the mid-1480s, most directly in the pose of the infant Baptist. The gaunt, long skull of St. Jerome further evokes many of Leonardo’s old, ascetic types, such as the apostle St. Simon at the far right of his Last Supper (c. 1495 – 97), which Marco himself copied.
A much smaller (72 x 58cm) and weaker version of this painting with a different landscape background was in the New York trade. It has not been determined whether it or more likely the Tata panel, can be identified with a painting auctioned in London in 1830 as Marco d’Oggiono, “The Holy Family, with an angel and St. John, in a Landscape. This Picture was a principal object in a Cause recently tried at Westminster Hall: Michelli v. Solly”

India is the home of the guru-shishya tradition where the pupils stay in the house of the teacher. The teacher is supposed to treat his students as his own sons. This tradition is prevalent even today especially in the fields of music and dance. Education involved not just the study of Vedic hymns, rituals, and philosophy, but also the study of the Upavedas which included the study of warfare (Dhanur-Veda), health (Ayurveda), theatre (Gandharva-Veda), time (Jyotish-shashtra), space (Vastu-shastra) and polity (Artha-shastra). At the end of the education, students were expected to pay their teacher’s fee before moving out of the teacher’s house. This is called guru-dakshina, a transaction fee, after which all obligations to the teacher were severed.

NH-B-8
DESCRIPTION
Scientific name: Cissa Chinensis
The common green magpie is a member of the crow family, roughly about the size of the Eurasian jay or slightly smaller. It is bright green in colour (often fades to turquoise in captivity), slightly lighter on the underside, and has a thick black stripe from its bill to the nape. The wings are reddish maroon. Due to excessive exposure to sunlight, they often appear turquoise (instead of green) in captivity. After its death, the colour of the bird changes to blue. Like other Magpies, the Green Magpies are shy birds and not easy to see.
It is found in the area starting from the lower Himalayas in northeastern India up to central Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, and north-western Borneo - in a broad south-easterly band- in evergreen forest, clearings, and scrub.
This bird finds its food both on the ground and in trees. They are carnivorous and mainly feed on arthropods and small vertebrates. It will also eat flesh from a recently killed carcass.
Green magpie builds hefty roofed nests mainly on the trees and tall bushes; often in tangles of various climbing vines. They mainly use sticks, leaves, and mud for building their bowl-shaped nest. They usually lay 4–6 eggs at a time. They are also known for their lifelong pairings.

The Chinese believe that when all flowers are in bloom, they augur good tidings and bring prosperity. This vase with a tall neck is covered with painted peonies, chrysanthemums, lotus, lilies, pink asters, and many other flowers. Known as millefleur in the West, this motif is known as baihuadi in Chinese, (hundred flower ground). This auspicious design was developed at the Qianlong imperial workshop to signify that the Qing empire would last as long as flowers continued to bloom, the motif flourished during the next two reigns. Though the blue seal on the base indicates that the vase was made in the Qianlong era, the piece was most probably made in the later Daoguang period, as indicated by the second character qing, which is missing a vertical stroke.

By the late 18th century CE, drawing and painting were making space for a variety of prints (lithographs and others) recording the land, its people, and their culture. A century later photographs replaced both as a more reliable visual record. After 1770, professional artists began to visit India and observe the country through the eyes of British taste. They made oil paintings for local British residents, as well as drawings, which could later be worked up in England into engravings. Suddenly the market had numerous copies of the same subject.
After the Anglo-Maratha war, the British residents started taking interest in western India. The appearance of Captain Robert Melville Grindlay’s book “Scenery, Costumes, and Architecture” shows a shift of interest from Eastern to Central India, Rajputana, Deccan, and Gujarat. This print captures the view of the mystical Kailash Temple at Ellora in Aurangabad district, Maharashtra, at a time when India was in the process of discovery. The late 18th to early 19th centuries were a time of many changes. History was transitioning from the medieval to the modern. Such records are important because the mid of the 19th century saw the rediscovery of an ancient India as well as the making of the modern. These prints record India as it was just before this transit.
It was drawn by Robert Melville Grindlay (1789 – 1877) and was drawn on the spot for the Hon Lady Hood by Captain Grindlay in 1813.

Phuldan (Flower Vase),https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/22.901.jpg,"Phuldan (Flower Vase)
22.901
DESCRIPTION
The ground of the tall, slender vase is richly ornamented with gold damascene work. The body of the vase is divided into four panels, each in the shape of a large petal. Each panel has eight-petalled flowers all over. Similar flowers decorate the neck and base. The term “damascening” is derived from the name of the ancient city of Damascus in Syria where it originated. It reached India during the Mughal period, probably through Iran and Afghanistan. Initially, this technique was used mainly to decorate hilts of daggers, swords, and shields. However, later it was also used to embellish articles of daily use like boxes, huqqa bases, vases, trays, etc. Metal objects, especially those of steel or iron, were embellished using the damascening technique. The art is practised in many countries though there are variations in the decoration from region to region. It is the art of decorating one metal with encrusted designs in another metal, usually gold or silver. A laborious technique is to cut grooves in the surface of the base metal, to receive thin gold leaf or wire which is hammered carefully into the incised pattern. In another technique, gold leaf or wire is inlaid or applied to a surface that has been prepared by crosshatching or chasing with a sharp tool. This work is a bit superficial compared to the former technique. It is therefore called koftgari or false damascening.

Venus and Adonis,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/22.4554.jpg,"Venus and Adonis
22.4554
DESCRIPTION
Adonis, in Greek mythology, is the god of beauty and desire. The narrative of Venus’ love for Adonis first appeared in the 1st century BCE Roman poet Ovid’s mythological narrative, ‘Metamorphoses’. As Adonis is about to go hunting in the forest, Venus seizes him and persuades him to love her, although Adonis is not very interested and cares only about hunting. After they part, Adonis is soon killed in a hunting accident. Venus’ sensuous nude figure is shown passively lying in the foreground while Adonis, with his hounds, is all set to escape from the scene for hunting. Cupid is shown pulling his cloak trying to divert his attention to Venus.
Giuseppe Bartolommeo Chiari was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque period, active mostly in Rome. In 1666 CE, joined the Italian Baroque painter Carlo Maratta or Maratti (1625 –1713) as an assistant and in a short period, he became one of the leading painters in early 18th century Rome, winning commission for major ceiling decoration in the Palazzo Barberini and the Palazzo Colonna.
The Venus’ figure is reminiscent in pose of ‘Sleeping Venus’ by Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco, (c. 1477/8–1510), Italian painter of the High Renaissance, which is on display in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Germany
Recently the signature of the artist has been discovered on the base of the chariot and near the left breast of Venus. The InfraRed image of the sign reads ‘Joseph Clarivs’- the anglicized version of the artist’s name.

The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary in Western Gujarat is the only habitat for the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica). The population recovered from the brink of extinction to 411 individuals in 2010. It is listed as Endangered by IUCN due to its small population size.
Severe hunting by Indian royalties and colonial personnel led to a steady and marked decline of lion numbers in the country. By 1880 only about a dozen lions were left in the Junagadh district. By the turn of the century, they were confined to the Gir Forest and protected by the Nawab of Junagadh in his private hunting grounds. In 2015, the lion population was estimated at 523 individuals.

DESCRIPTION
From the set of Baramasa paintings
Hindu month of Pausa. The poet Keshavdas says that:
In the month of Pausa, nobody likes cold things, whether they are water, food, dress, or house. Even the earth and sky have become cold. In this season everyone rich and poor alike, likes oil (massage of oil), cotton (cotton-filled clothes), betel, fire (to warm the room), sunshine, and the company of women. (During the month) the days are short and nights are dark and long. This is not the time to quarrel with one’s lover (meaning thereby that this is the time of union of lovers). Keeping all these aspects in mind the Beloved asks her Lover not to leave her in the month of Pausa.
'Baramasa' or 'Songs of the twelve months' is a poetic genre that describes each of the months of the Indian calendar in terms of love and its rhetoric. The most famous one is Keshavdasa’s Kavipriya which mirrors his mastery of the selection of words and phrases and describes the life, ceremonies, and rituals of the people in different seasons. It is a popular subject in Bundi School as it allows the artists to indulge in their love for landscape.

DESCRIPTION
Devi or the great goddess is the divine feminine aspect that is being worshipped by Indians throughout the ages. She is worshipped in both benevolent and ferocious form and known by various names like Uma, Gauri, Parvati, Jagadamba, Bhairavi, Durga, Kali, Chandi, Bhavani, Chamunda and so on. Her worship symbolizes the acceptance of female energy.
Since prehistoric times female energy is worshipped as a giver of life and fertility. Indus Valley sites (2600- 1900 BCE) have yielded a large number of female clay figurines which are probably of mother goddesses.
During the Gupta period (320- 647 CE) the worship of the Great Goddesses gained popularity. By this time the text- 'Devi Mahatmya' glorifying Devi was composed. Devi Mahatmya considers that Devi represents all three aspects – Prakriti (creation), Maya (illusion) and shakti (power). She creates, pervades and sustains the Universe. Shakti here is not a consort of male deity but rather she is a universal phenomenon, the sole reality.
The goddess is worshipped in her benign (Saumya) and ferocious (Ugra) forms. In her ferocious form, she is the slayer of demons like Madhu-Kaitabh, Mahishasura, Shumbha, Nishumbha. She has several manifestations that are dreadful, dangerous and bloodthirsty.

97.12/4
DESCRIPTION
Paithani textile derives its name from Paithan, a small town near Nasik, which is the centre of its production even today. It is a typical creation of the weavers of Maharashtra and its peculiarity lies in the use of an interlocking technique to create borders and designs in highly contrasting colours.
Like several other regional styles of weaving, Paithani is also a family-based craft passing from generation to generation. Minute minakari designs in the pallu using various colours is woven with the help of multiple spindles (tillies), which makes it a very laborious and complicated task. Paithani textiles mainly consist of sari, pugdi piece, dhoti and dupatta, out of which, the sari of course is the most elaborate. The sari generally has brocade borders and a big golden pallu with colourful floral and other designs. Occasionally, the ground is decorated with fine buties in gold. The pallu is richly decorated with a variety of motifs like asavali, akroti, bangdimor, Ajanta lotus and huma parinda. Some of the saris have a coin motif known as ashrafi spread all over the fabric.
The ruling families of the Peshwas particularly patronised Paithani. Their fondness for Paithani is reflected in many of the letters ordering dhotis, dupattas, turbans etc. in different varieties and colours. Documents show their preference for plain dhoti with silver and gold thread work, turbans in green and dupatta having asavali or narali work in red, pink, orange and green. Besides Paithan, many other regional centres began to weave Paithani. Yeola, one such centre became famous for its mango designs. Paithani was not only popular with the Marathas but it also attracted the Nizam of Hyderabad and his family who had visited the Paithani centre several times. His daughter-in-law Begum Nilofar even introduced new motifs to the border as we as pallu designs.
Traditionally known as Jambhul Rang Paithani, this purple Paithani originally belonged to the Nizam family as reported by the collector herself. It has nearly woven Jai Phul (Jasmine) jari butis all over which are closely spaced near the pallu. The broad borders are done in narali pattern. On the ground near the pallu there are eight guldasta butis in the shape of mango and a diaper of cartouches containing flowers done in a silver jari. A beautiful interplay of gold and silver is seen in the silver mango motifs on the golden pallu. The pallu also has a band of vine pattern border running all around.

DESCRIPTION
Hanuman is the name for both a species of money as well as the devout simian follower of Rama, the divine hero of the epic Ramayana and an avatar of Vishnu. Apart from being represented with Rama, Hanuman is the focus of widespread worship by Hindus as a remover of difficulties (sankatamochana). This image once certainly belonged to a group that must have included Rama, Lakshmana, one of Rama’s siblings, and his spouse Sita. From Hanuman’s posture and attitude of devotion, it can be surmised he would have faced his master.
But for his simian head and the tail that rises to the back of the head, he is essentially a human figure. His hands are joined against his chest in the classic Indian gesture of greeting and devotion. He wears a dhoti with a broad belt and several hanging ornaments over his garment that create a pleasing rhythmic pattern. By contrast, the torso is more sparsely adorned though there is a suggestion of a short jacket around the chest. Only a few of the ornaments and the dhoti are represented on the back which is otherwise well modelled.

The artist's interpretation of the undisturbed happiness which Rama and Sita were not to enjoy for long, is undeniably sensitive. There is a sense of isolation which is suggested by the battlemented walls that shut out the palace from the outer world. The royal couple seems so far away from the whispered rumours of evil tongues, which are to end their newfound bliss. Here in the company of a few adoring handmaidens and the ever-faithful Hanuman, there is peace and rest and soft music after the long travail. The maiden in the middle of the group to the right holds Rama's bow and quiver of arrows. They are a reminder of the days in the forest and the struggle against Ravana. Rama also wears a flower garland. Comic relief is afforded by Hanuman who glances up at the girl playing the drum as if he does not approve of her performance. The Indian artist was always most successful in humanizing Hanuman's monkey form.
The curtain, partly rolled up, at the top of the picture, is a common device borrowed from Mughal painting, while the doorkeeper standing in the distant entrance-arch, is another favourite Mughal cliché derived from Persian miniatures. The workmanship of this painting is of high excellence, particularly the faces of Rama and Sita, which are in Kangra kalam and have a delicate porcelain-like finish, which the colour reproduction fails to convey. Airy pavilions of white or pink stone and semicircular arches supported by elegant pillars were greatly in fashion. Silver was used for woven and painted textiles, huqqas, and other objects. It was also used to depict water and lotuses. Silver tarnishes after a time and in consequence, it is always seen as a metallic grey-black wherever it appears in Pahari paintings. The cushions in the painting are an instance in point. The mount surrounding the miniature is pink with close hatching of short strokes in a darker pink.
Though ascribed to Mandi, women with similar features are also found in paintings from Guler and Chamba, and this painting could equally well be assigned to Guler. Roerich acquired a similar painting stated to be the work of a Mandi artist; hence, the Mandi attribution. But in this connection, the migration of artists from one state to another must always be borne in mind.

Plate with the Birth of John the Baptist,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/22.4521.jpg,"Plate with the Birth of John the Baptist
22.4521
DESCRIPTION
Sir Ratan Tata Art Collection
The circular plate is painted in grisaille, heightened with flesh tones, small touches of red, and gilding. The centre depicts the birth of St. John the Baptist, within a band of griffons, masks, and vases on the black ground around the rim; the reverse is painted with four masks and strapwork, within rubbed gilded bands of arabesques and laurel. The reverse bears two old paper labels, including an exhibition or dealer’s label with initials A.S. & C.
This plate probably belonged to a set painted with a series of scenes from the life of St. John the Baptist. The story of his birth is only told in the Gospel of Luke.
The Tata plate is not signed but is close in style to the work of Jean de court (active 1555-85). He was not the inventor of the decoration, however. The ornamental border and strapwork to the reverse are in the typical decorative language of mid to late 16th century Mannerism and the main subject, set in a fashionable contemporary interior and depicting the newborn being washed and, in the background, being dried and warmed by the fire, is almost certainly derived from an engraving. The exact source has not been traced but a cycle of engravings of the life of the Baptist by Martin van Heemskerck includes a very similarly composed scene.

DESCRIPTION
Gift of Shri Bansi Mehta from his wife Sushila Asher’s Collection.
Batik is one of the earliest methods used for creating designs on fabrics. There are diverse opinions regarding the origin of the art. According to some scholars it originated in China while some ascribe its origin to India and Java. Popularly it is known as the Javanese art of wax printing. The design is created by the resist dyeing process using wax as the resist, which retains the original fabric colour in the patterns, after dyeing the material. It was forgotten in our country till the University of Shantiniketan revived the art around 1923. Pratima Tagore learned this Batik technique in Paris and started the workshops at Shantiniketan.
The present sari is a unique example of Batik specially designed sometime around 1940 by Nandalal Bose, a renowned artist of the Bengal School, for a performance to be staged in front of Gurudev Tagore. Gauri, the daughter of Nandababu, executed it in Batik. The sari is designed on motia or off-white fine silk and the patterns were drawn with brush and tjanting method in which a copper vessel filled with hot wax is used. A gentle flow of wax is maintained through the spout to draw a freehand design. The brown silk sari has bold floral creeper designs on the pallu, border, and in the centre where it is to be pleated into multiple folds.
The sari was worn by Sushila Asher while performing the famous dance drama Shyama as well as Natir puja in 1940, in the presence of Gurudev Tagore.

DESCRIPTION
Sir D. J. Tata Collection
The impressive lamp must have been made for a Vaishnava temple. Garuda, the vahana (mount) of Lord Vishnu, is shown in human form, identified by his large out-stretched wings and sharp, beak-like nose. He wears a mukuta (crown) with a serpant, earrings, necklace, armbands, kadas (bangles), and yajnopavita (sacred thread), and has the typical U-shaped Vaishnava tilaka on his forehead and similar marks on his body. He is shown subduing a Naga with his left knee. This is a symbolic representation of the mythology connected with Garuda and his Naga cousins whom he defeated.
The interesting part of this figure is the lamp placed behind Garuda’s head. The lamp is in the form of a padma (lotus) which is also one of the attributes of Vishnu. Interestingly the lamp can be opened and closed as required. When not in use, the form presented is that of a lotus bud, but unscrewing the bud to use the lamp the fuel receptacle appears as a round bowl forming the centre of a full-bloomed lotus.
The practice of using animal and bird figures for lamps and other ritual objects is common in India. This is probably because the vahana which is favourite of a particular deity is a suitable medium for conveying a devotee’s gift or offering to the god. The Garudadipa is one of the 16 lamp types (Shodashadipa Lakshana) mentioned in the Shilpashastras.

S 80
DESCRIPTION
This is a fragment of what must have been a magnificent image of Mahishasuramardini. In the mythological story, the witty demon Mahisha troubled the Gods endlessly until Goddess Durga came to their help. She killed the demon Mahisha (who is in the form of a buffalo) and therefore is known as ‘Mahishasuramardini’ – one who killed the buffalo demon. This sculpture is from the nearby Elephanta caves. It is overpowering with its strength and vigour. The artist has vividly captured the forceful attack of the goddess on the buffalo demon and depicts his agony, as he turns his head up in deadly action.
The tail of the buffalo is curled as it happens with the cattle in times of anxiety. The goddess has her foot on the back of the buffalo demon completely subjugating him. Even though the upper part of the sculpture is lost, the modelling of the solid mass of the body of the buffalo, the firm, strong legs of the goddess, and vivid depiction of her act of killing, suggests the work of a great artist.
Elephanta is an island located about 12 kms. away from this Museum. The cave structures are decorated with grand and marvellous stone sculptures. Though many of these sculptures are mutilated, their sizes, as well as the quality of workmanship, testify to their importance as sculptures from Western India.

Raas Krida on Sharad Purnima,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/78.7-2.jpg,"Raas Krida on Sharad Purnima
78.7-2
DESCRIPTION
Dance, drama, and music forms an essential part of the Bhagavata sect since ancient times. As early as 400 B.C. Bhasa the great dramatist presents Raas dance associated with the Bhagavata cult. There is a mention in the Bhagavata Purana where Krishna says that “My stories should be sung, danced and enacted on festive occasions” (XI.27.44).
Philosophically the most important dance of Krishna is the Raasmandala (Raas Lila) meaning circle of delight or ecstasy. The love of Krishna and the gopis takes place in a circle that has no beginning nor an end and goes on and on for eternity. In the Vaishnava cult, this mystic dance has a special ritualistic significance.
Dashma Skanda of Bhagavata Purana describes the Raas Lila of Krishna. With a desire to sport with gopis on a full moon night of Sharada Ritu (October-November), Krishna invites gopis by playing melodious music on his flute. Enchanted by the music, gopis rush to him and Krishna starts dancing and sporting with them amorously. On receiving Krishna’s favour gopis feel immense pride. Realizing this, Krishna disappears from the scene and comes back only on the repeated pleading of the gopis and plays maharass with them. With his divine power, he multiplies himself and dances with all the gopis and simultaneously. He thus convinces them that he participates in their lives, giving freely of himself to each and everyone and ensuring that he is lovingly and completely available to his devotees. The dance leads the gopis to the path of liberation where the individual soul jivatman joins the divine soul parmatman.
There is a long tradition of circular dance in India. The earliest reference of a circular dance is in the Harivansha Purana (5th century A.D.). The dance is referred to here as ‘Hallishaka’ where many women dance in a circle around one man. In Indian Philosophy a circle has many symbolic connotations.
Svetastara Upanishada says:
“This Universe is a wheel
Upon it are all creatures that are subject to
Birth, death, and rebirth
Round and round it turns
And never stops”.
The Tradition of raas dance still continues.
Krishna through Yogamaya became many so that he could give his love to all. He was like a sapphire in a necklace of gold. There was such harmony of ragas and raginis that hearing it, water and wind no longer flowed. The moon together with the starry sky being astonished rained down nectar with its rays. The wives of Gods gathered in the sky. Meanwhile, night advanced and six months had passed. The name of that night has been the night of Brahma.

DESCRIPTION
This type of lamp is popular throughout India. If consist of an elegantly attired woman who connotes the goddess Lakshmi with a lamp in her hands. Dipa Lakshmi is generally shown standing on a lotus or elephant. In some part of India there is practice of gifting Dipa Lakshmi on elephant to newly wed daughters at festival time to bestow prosperity and fertility on her.
One of the most important milestones in the history of mankind is the discovery of fire. It has played a very crucial role in the progress and development of man and therefore, in India, fire and lamps are considered very auspicious.
In earlier times, lamps were perhaps only wicks lit in hollows or shallow depressions in stone. Later on, lamps were made of sea shells, clay and various metals like brass, copper and silver. In the ‘Ramayana’ and the ‘Mahabharata’ there are references to lamps made of gold. The earliest lamp was simple - a small bowl made of clay with a beak-like projection, popularly known as Panti. Interestingly, this type of lamp is found in India as early as the Harappan period (3300 BCE to 1800 BCE) and continues till this date!
In India, lamp symbolizes the human body and flame symbolizes the soul. Thus the individual is a Deepak (lamp) and the soul is a jeevan jyoti (the flame of life). Indians believe, that the soul is immortal. Even after the death of a person, a lamp is lit to guide the departing soul into the other world.
At every stage of life therefore, lamps are lit to celebrate the eternal life force. In earlier times special lamps were lit at coronation ceremonies, on the return of a victorious warrior and at every other important occasion. The aarti (ritualistic adoration with lighted lamps) is performed even today to strengthen and establish relationship between man and God, brother and sister, wife and husband, mother and child. Ancient texts mention Deepadaan (gifting of lamp) as a act of high merit. There are several festivals connected with lamps – Deep Amavasya (July – August), Diwali (October – November) and Ganga poojan which are celebrated with great pomp.
With the passage of time there has been innovation in the types and shapes of lamps meant for different occasions and requirement.

DESCRIPTION
Illustrated folio from the set of Mewar Ramayana
The Museum acquired nineteen folios of a dispersed Ramayana set painted during the patronage of Maharana Jagat Singh I (1628-52 CE), whose atelier was crowned by two great artists: Sahebdin and Manohar. The king seems to have been particularly interested in large and extensive illustrations of the epics and the puranas. Though Mewar paintings are known from the time of Chawand Ragamala dated 1605 CE, the Mewar style was properly defined by the paintings of these illustrated manuscripts. Sahebdin and Manohar continued to a great extent with the Indian colour tonalities, flat backgrounds, prominently Indian narrative style and bold draughtsmanship. The colophon reads: In Samvat 1706, on the thirteenth day of the dark half of Margasirsha, Thursday, in the city of Udaipur situated in Mewar, in the victorious reign of Maharajadhiraj Maharana Jagat Singh, the painter Manohar (illustrated the manuscript).
The book was written by Mahatma Hirananda at the command of the teacher Jasvantji.

73.5/62
DESCRIPTION
Folios from an illustrated manuscript of Anwar-i-Suhayli
The painting illustrates the story of friendship between a gardener and a bear, proving the old saying that a wise enemy is in every way better than an ignorant friend.
Anwar-i-Suhayli is a Persian translation by Vaiz Kashifi of Kalilah-wa-Damnah, an Arabic version of the Panchtantra, an old Indian Fable. This richly illustrated manuscript was commissioned by Emperor Akbar - the great Mughal ruler.
In the second half of the 19th century, this manuscript was in the library of the Honorable Mountstuart Elphinstone in Poona which caught fire. This manuscript consisting of over two hundred illustrations, was saved and though badly damaged, some art lover retrieved the less damaged folios by mounting them on a uniform size paper which were bound in an album form. Sir Alma Latifi, a member of the Indian Civil Service, purchased this album at a sale of Sotheby’s in London in 1938, and it was bequeathed to the Museum in 1973 by the family. A few loose folios of the manuscript have dispersed. Not a single folio has remained intact. However, the artistic quality of the surviving 231 paintings, some of which are mere tidbits, suggests a well-planned and organised production under the supervision of a master artist, who in all probability could be Abd-al Samad.
The manuscript can be considered a landmark in the naturalistic and masterly studies of animals and birds. A whole world of animals and birds unfolds before us as they are seen running and chasing, holding assemblies and consultations, conspiring against others and even participating in human affairs. The Mughal style is seen completely liberated from the Persian idiom and has achieved an identity of its own as a naturalistic painting.
There is no doubt that a large number of real study drawings must have been made by the artists to portray them so effectively and realistically, in varied actions and moods. In that respect, the manuscript is an original creation of the Mughal atelier revealed considerable imagination in the rendering and composition of the paintings.

King Songtsen Gampo (died Circa 650 CE) introduced Buddhism in Tibet. Though he did not claim any supernatural powers, he was deified and worshipped by the people as the incarnation of Chenresik or Avalokiteshvara, the great protector of Tibet. His images began appearing soon after his death. This one is very similar to the huge terracotta images (8th century CE) of the king at Potala Palace, Lhasa. It is identified by the depiction of the Dhyani Buddha, Amitabha on his tall pleated headgear, as in the images of Avalokiteshvara. The king is seated in Lalitasana while his right hand is raised in Abhayamudra, a gesture of reassurance. The dress and ornaments are similar to those of any royal figure of Tibet. Typical of the male coiffure of Central India, his hair is arranged in two long plaits, which cross each other at the back and fall loose on the shoulders in the front.

DESCRIPTION
This sculpture is the legacy of the famous 19th Century archaeologist Henry Cousens who excavated the site of a stupa at Mirpurkhas, one of the most important and well-preserved sites of the Indo-Greek Buddhist settlements. This terracotta was found leaning against the north wall of the central shrine. Curiously, this is the only secular image among the large number of religious figures found at the site. The image probably represents a donor disciple who contributed towards the construction of the stupa.
The modelling is a bit heavy, but the expressive face, particularly the half-closed thoughtful eyes, the sharp arch of the eyebrows and the full lips impart an unusual charm to the figure. Look how the hair is arranged with care. The ear ornaments do not match each other: the left earring is larger and has three pearl drops. Possibly this special earring indicates a position of office. (A similar custom in Tibet was prevalent till the 18th Century where high officials in the government wore a special kind of earring in one ear.) The elaborate hairdo also seems to be a mark of an important position in the state administration. The devotee’s elegantly-draped striped dhoti (lower garment) has traces of paint. The manner in which he holds the flower is reminiscent of the famous painting, Bodhisattva Padmapani, in cave No.1 at Ajanta.

Bahubali,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/B105-Bahubali_02.jpg,"Bahubali
B 105
DESCRIPTION
Bahubali was the second son of the first Jaina Tirthankara (teacher) Rishabhanatha. Though not a Tirthankara himself, he is worshipped by the Digambara (sky-clad) sect of the Jains as an enlightened soul, and is revered for his severe austerities. The story goes that Rishabhanatha left the kingdom to his son Bharata, who in order to become a Chakravartin (a sovereign), had to overpower his brother, Bahubali in a public duel. Bahubali, as the name suggests, had a powerful physique and arms of steel. He lifted Bharata and flung him to the ground twice. As he was about to do it the third time, wisdom dawned and he realized the futility of worldly power. He gently put down his brother, and went away to the forest in search of Truth. He performed such severe austerities that ant-hills grew around him and creepers wound round his legs and spread all over his body.
The modelling of this exquisite bronze figure is the work of a great artist. Bahubali stands in the Kayotsarga (meditative) pose. Creepers designed as a uniform decorative pattern, are carved in high relief on his legs and arms. His hair falls back in straight lines and some of the tassels fall on his shoulders indicating his lineage from Rishabhanatha. The image characterizes him very well as an invincible warrior with heavy, broad shoulders, while the softness of his benign smile exudes his spiritual achievement.

DESCRIPTION
The cuirass was common during the Mughal period and seems to have been more popular than the coat-of-mail. It is made of two pieces, a breastplate and a backplate. This breastplate was probably moulded to the shape of Emperor Akbar’s torso. Notice the high neck collar, intended to protect the throat. This is an uncommon feature in Indian armour. The quality of the steel, the high water mark and the distinct damascened work indicate that the armour was manufactured with great care. Emperor Akbar personally supervised the production of his arms. In his memoirs, Akbar mentions in great detail the process and the tests he carried out to select his armour. The helmet is decorated with delicate gold damascene and has a spike at the apex. The two arm guards are decorated in koftgari along the edges. The breastplate has a decoration along the sides and on the lower rim. In the centre are inscriptions from the Koran in fine Nastaliq script. The inscription on the collar reads:
“The personal garment of the emperor of lofty fortune, Akbar. Year A. H. 989 = CE 1581.”

DESCRIPTION
Lila Hava is the playful love game of Radha and Krishna imagined by the Pushti Margi ashtachap poet Surdasa.
In a playful mood Radha requests Krishna
“You become Radha and I will become Madhava
Truly Madhava, this is the reversal which I shall produce.
I will braid your hair and will put your crown
Upon my head.
Suradasa says:
Thus Krishna became Radha and
Radha the son of Nanda.”
Radha and Madhava
Madhava and Radha
The two became one
Madhava soaked in Radha’s colour
Radha soaked in Madhava’s colour
Radha immersed in Madhava
Their love is eternal.
words are unable to sing of it.
Sweetly smiling he said you and I
Are not two We are inseparable…
Suradasa
The painting shows Radha and Krishna seated in the solitude of the forest enjoying the ecstasy of love. Radha fully immersed in the shringara rasa is wearing just a translucent odhani. The amorous play of the couple has reached its fulfilment and now Radha, whose inner soul is already united with her beloved is eager to change her outer appearance “you become Radha and I will become Madhava!” She has crowned herself with the mukuta of Madhava (Krishna) and now doing shringara of Krishna. Their love-drenched eyes are completely lost in each other. The artist seems to have understood the philosophy of the theme very well. The lush green forest with a few blossoms and a few chirping birds are the only witnesses to this divine drama. The bluish-grey background suggests the advent of dawn.
Founded in 1658 the Gaharwal atelier became dominated by Molaram (1743-1843) who produced some brilliant paintings filled with life and colour and resonant of Krishna.

Shoeing the horse,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Shoeing-the-horse.jpg,"Shoeing the horse
2009.95
DESCRIPTION
A handsome blue roan with a rich saddlecloth is attended by the groom, his assistant, and a man fixing the horseshoe. Though standing quietly while being shoed, its eyes are wide open with fear. The well-proportioned body indicates an excellent breed. The groom holds the horse’s foot by a black rope to facilitate the fixing of the shoe. An open bag full of horseshoes and nails is lying in front. All the men are dressed in fine transparent muslin garments.
This lightly coloured drawing, in the style known as nim kalam, is in all probability a portrait of a favourite horse commissioned by Ibrahim Adil Shah II (1580–1627). The drawing is by a well-known artist Ali Jafar, whose signature appears on the cloth around the neck of the horse.
The emphasis is on the fine quality of drawing on natural shade paper, and the monotony is relieved by a richly brocaded saddle cloth lined with a bright orange coloured textile as well as a number of ornaments on the horse. In the words of Khandalavala, ...frequently during the later Safavid period and early Shah Abbas period of Persian painting great importance was given to the quality of drawing for its own sake, without undue emphasis on colour which was used only to relieve any sense of monotony. There is no doubt that this fashion of producing lightly coloured drawings influenced Deccani artists.
In this painting, we have a fine example of this style of work. However, the close affinity of this painting with the Mughal style cannot be ignored, particularly in the depiction of the man hammering the nail to fix the shoe.
Though Ibrahim Adil Shah II was a known patron of painting, and a number of exquisite paintings were produced during his reign, only two of them bear authentic signatures, and both are by Ali Jafar. A painting of a maiden leading a gazelle, reproduced by Zebrowski, bears an identical signature within a cartouche. Another horse study in the same style preserved in the Seth Kasturbhai Lal bhai Collection is probably by the same artist.

53.59
DESCRIPTION
Raja Sansarchand, the ruler of Kangra (1775-1783 CE) was an ardent devotee of Krishna and as narrated by Moorcroft there were lively celebrations of festivals related to Krishna with dancing and music in his court. The painting depicts the celebration of Janmashtami, the birth of Krishna. In the Pushti Sampradaya which particularly propagated the worship of young Krishna, this is a major festival. Since Krishna is believed to have been born at midnight, the festivities usually go on throughout the night as indicated by several oil lamps with gold flames lighting up the room in this painting. As is customary we dames the family shrine is decorated with strings of flowers behind which can be seen a small swing for the newborn babe, Krishna. A priest is performing the puja whereas two attendants are waving the chauri on either side of the shrine. Raja Sansarchand clad in a dark green dress is prominently seated in front, slightly to the left of the court gathering. Rows of seated courtiers are in front of him as well as behind him. The child participant is his son, Anirudhachand probably seated on the lap of Fatehachand, the brother of the king. A group of dancers and musicians are performing to celebrate the birth of Kristina and bright firecrackers at the entrance also set the mood of jubilation. The devotees from the palace and the town have gathered outside the shrine to participate in it. The venue d painting in all probability is the durbar hall at Sancharchand's palace on the hill of Sujanour Tera. Sancharchand, acclaimed as a great patron of art, particularly painting, attracted many artists, three of whom-Khushala, Fattu and Purkhu have acquired fame. However, there is no clue to the painter of this beautiful painting, recording a very important event in the palace. The present painting was in the possession of Zaildar Shri Ram Singh Banuril of Bhuwarna, a descendant of Sancharchand.
Quite unlike the other Kangra paintings, set against a lush green background of variegated trees, this painting is painted against the dull white background of the walls of the palace.

Keshalocha of Mahavira,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Keshalocha-of-Mahavira.jpg,"Keshalocha of Mahavira
55.65 - 37
DESCRIPTION
From the illustrated Manuscript of Kalpasutra and Kalakacharya Katha
This painting depicts one of the five important episodes in the life of a Jina (forder), which are considered very auspicious. These are known as Pancha kalyanakas i.e., Birth, Renunciation, Enlightenment, Preaching and final Emancipation.
Mahavira the 24th Jain Tirthankara forsakes his princely position and renounces the world. Here we see him performing the ceremony of plucking out his hair to become a monk. Jain monks do not shave but pluck their hair as a symbol of the beginning of hard austerities.
Seated on a stylised purple mountain in the form of a flame, Mahaviraholds his hair with one hand in an effort to pluck them out. The attendant is Shakra (Indra) who is in all attention to collect Mahavira’s hair in his outstretched hands.
The upper section of the painting depicts Mahavira giving away his devadushya (divine cloth) to the Brahmin Soma. Indra had once given this garment to Mahavira.
Kalpasutra is a well-known Jain canonical text describing the life of Mahavira and other Tirthankaras. Kalakacharya Katha is probably a semi-historical tale of the 1st Century CE narrating the story of the monk Kalaka. This story was added to the Kalpasutra in later times. These manuscripts were often donated by the devotees to the temples to attain spiritual merit.

Elephant in Musth,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Elephant-in-Musth.jpg,"Elephant in Musth
2009.118
DESCRIPTION
On a dark night of the fifth day of the month of Magasar (November–December), the royal elephant Madar Bagas has gone out of control while in a rut. Only an artist like Chokha1 who excelled in recreating the atmosphere and the mood of the moment in his paintings could capture such a scene. He has subtly used shades of black and grey, and the technique of heavy stippling and fine lines to enhance the body contours of the elephant. Chokha was fond of using black in his paintings as seen in his “Mother and Child” in the collection of Alvin O. Bellak.
All four legs of the elephant are heavily chained, making it impossible for him to free even one of them. The person standing in front of him is trying to control him with firecrackers. The people working around appear tiny insignificant creatures in front of the mad, but a majestic elephant. The white tusks against the dark background emphasize his fierceness. The shimmering metal chains glow in the light of the firecrackers thrown at him. The dark sky is dotted with tiny, glittering stars. The artist has emphasized the pinkish swollen gland between the ear and the eye of the elephant to suggest his state of musth which generally occurs in the winter months from November to January.
Chokha was the son of the artist Bagta who worked for Maharana Ari Singh at Udaipur in the 1760s, and later for the Rawats of Deogarh circa 1790–1811. At Deogarh Chokha produced excellent works under the patronage of Rawat Gokuldas. There is an interesting inscription on the flyleaf. It records the details of nine paintings of different rulers which were probably obtained along with this one. It proves that there was a considerable exchange of paintings between the rulers of various states in the 19th century.

78.5/9
DESCRIPTION
QUITE unlike the pichhavai of figurative paintings used by Vaishnavas to decorate their shrines, the Jains seem to have preferred rich jari embroidery work to provide background to the images of their Tirthankaras. Even today, many small and big embroidered rectangular wall-hangings used as a backdrop and canopy over the image, known as the Chod and the Chandaravo respectively, are ordered by Jains in large numbers, particularly for the celebration at the end of the 40th day fast during Paryushana. It is possible that originally as the name indicates, the backdrop illustrated a small tree (chod) symbolising the tree under which the Tirthankara attained enlightenment.
Jari embroidery was a much-developed craft and there are about thirteen different varieties of material used for this kind of embroidery, which was generally done on velvet or on heavy silk. These materials are known as Surma, Jhik, Tiki, Tas, Tui, Badla, Kasab and Kangani. They are made out of wire or flat strips of silver. The craftsmen of Ahmedabad and Surat were particularly known for this embroidery and the Jain temples partronised them. The jari embroidery of Gujarat was famous even in the 13th century as noted by Marco Polo.
A rectangular wall hanging with crimson satin ground is finely embroidered in various kinds of silk and gilt materials of different types used in jari embroidery. A wall piece is imagined as a niche enclosed between two half pillars with bell and cushion-shape base and similar capital on either side, supporting beautiful arches on top. The sun and moon are prominently placed in two top corners while elegant peacocks flank the flower decoration in the centre. The ground is covered by a jal of lozenges with a flower in each, creating a rich brocade effect. The borders are decorated with floral motifs and a winding creeper whereas the four corners have big eight-petalled flowers on a red background. The museum also has in its collection, the Chandarvo or a square a canopy, of the same material and design to match this wall-hanging.

S 117
DESCRIPTION
This image of the 16th Tirthankara, Shantinatha, was a part of a magnificent marble temple of the 12th Century CE. The intricately carved sculpture is an early image with an elaborate prabhavali (halo) inset with many figures. Here, Shantinatha stands in meditation, calm and composed, in the Kayotsarga (meditative) pose. A donor couple sits in prayerful supplication on either side of his feet. The chauri bearers, standing behind the donors, wave their chauris, under the long hands of the Jina.
There are three Vidyadevis, the goddesses of knowledge, on each side of Shantinatha who has attained supreme knowledge. Their presence on the torana stambha is a cliché often used in the Jaina images by Rajasthani artists of the 11th and 12th Centuries. Jain devotees preferred white marble for the images of their pantheon: It suits the idea of purity of the Jina, whose soul is absolutely purified.
The inscription on the pedestal reads: “In Vikram Samvat 1195 (1138 CE) an image of Shantinatha Jina was made by Gargasuri of Shri Jineswaracharya Sangha of Shri Sarvalagaccha at Shri Sarasthana, for his own merit.

This is plate 1 from James Baillie Fraser's 'Views of Calcutta and its Environs'. Fraser arrived in Calcutta in 1814 and in six years had produced these animated sketches of the busy city, published later as a collection of twenty-four superbly aquatinted plates.
This first plate in the collection extends from the west end of the city, where Esplanade Row meets the River Hooghly. It was the main landing place for visitors to the fast-growing city. The chunam (lime) - covered buildings, shining brightly in the sunshine, as here, were an exciting introduction to the city.

DESCRIPTION
Archaeologists have discovered over a thousand cities and towns datable between 3000 and 1700 BCE across regions of Gujarat, Sindh, Balochistan, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab. Baked bricks, like this example were used to construct houses in the larger Harappan cities, while sun-dried mud bricks were used for houses in smaller towns. The cities themselves were built on massive mud-brick platforms and are famous for their beautifully conceived granaries, reservoirs, wells and street lined with drains.
A city is made up of bricks and mortar, but construction apart, mobility is central to its working. Indus cities had well-developed trade systems reliant on rural agricultural communities, mines and contact with areas from where important resources could be sourced. Pack animals, riverboats and carts were used for transport.

Storage Jar,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Potsherds-Storage-Jar.jpg,"Storage Jar
1637
DESCRIPTION
The Harappan jar consists of three parts- a narrow base that is usually made in a chuck or using a mould, a large rounded body and a narrow neck, both of which were made separately and added on to the base. The points where the three sections are attached are smoothed over. But since the mid-section of the jar is thick and heavy, the string is tied around this section to keep it together after the pot has been shaped. The string leaves an impression on the soft clay when the jar is fired and the string burns away.
The jar is coated with a red or purple-black slip on the inside and a black or purple-black slip on the outside. The slips that create an impermeable surface, the large size of the jar and their narrow necks suggest that they were most suitable for storing liquids (wine or water) or grains.
Similar jars have been found in a number of Indus sites such as Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Chanhudaro and others. They have also been found in Hili in modern-day UAE and since they are not part of the local assemblage there, it clearly shows that these jars were brought there from Harappan sites.

The Indian Chameleon is a species of chameleon found in Sri Lanka, India, and other parts of South Asia. Like other chameleons, this species has a long tongue, feet that are shaped into bifid claspers, a prehensile tail, independent eye movement, and the ability to change skin colour. They move slowly with a bobbing or swaying movement and are usually arboreal. Strangely, they do not choose the background colour and may not even be able to perceive colour differences. They are usually in shades of green or brown or with bands. They can change colour rapidly and the primary purpose of colour change is for communication with other chameleons and for controlling body temperature by changing to dark colours to absorb heat.

DESCRIPTION
Rupiya (Sanskrit – Rupyaka) means a piece of silver. The currency of Rupiya or what we call the Rupee was introduced by Sher Shah Suri around 1540 CE. He standardised the weight of the Rupee at 178 grains (11.60 Gms) and gave it the name of Rupiya. The Mughal rulers continued with the currency of Rupiya along with its lower denomination the ‘Paisa’. It then became the standard currency for the whole of India and was introduced in other colonial countries during the British rule. The silver content of the rupee gradually decreased to such an extent that today it has no silver content at all. The present rupee coin is made of nickel.
The term Rupee is also used for currency in Nepal, Indonesia, Maldives, Mauritius, Pakistan, Seychelles and Sri Lanka.

DESCRIPTION
King Vasudev is shown here wearing a long Iranian coat, making an offering to the fire.
Kushana, a nomadic tribe from the Chinese frontier, controlled the North-West part of ancient India, traditionally
known as Gandhara (now in Pakistan). The Kushanas came through Bactria, and their innovative and creative abilities are
reflected in their art as well as in their coins. They were the first to issue gold coins in India.
Initially imitating Greek coins, the Kushana later developed their own distinctive style. Like the Romans, they too wished to use their coins as a means of communicating to their subjects their own glory. Thus the king is seen in various attitudes — seated, standing, or riding an elephant.
The reverse of their coins is like a picture reference of deities from Greek, Bactrian and Indian pantheons. Having legends in Brahmi, Kharoshti and Greek, their coins were mainly made of gold and copper. Kanishka was the most known king among them.

DESCRIPTION
The earliest evidence of metal currency in India goes back to the 7th Century BCE, about 2700 years ago! These early coins were made in silver and have no significant shape or size. They are found in round, oval, square, rectangle, and other angular forms. These early coins have no inscriptions on them but are punched with various symbols like human figures, floral and geometrical patterns, religious symbols, trees, and plant motifs, etc. They are called punch-marked coins.
There were sixteen main states known as Shodasha Mahajanapadas in Ancient India. These earliest punch-marked coins were issued by these sixteen states. They had names like Magadha, Kuru, Panchala, Surasena, Gandhara, etc.
In the 3rd Century BCE, the Magadha Janapada acquired supremacy over a large area, and with the extension of Mauryan power, their coins became the currency of the sub-continent.
These Mauryan coins generally have five symbols on them and have a thicker flan. Each symbol is specific to a particular region.

DESCRIPTION
The art of Bidri was very popular from the early 17th Century CE. It takes its name from the city of Bidar in the Deccan where it originated. It was used for a wide variety of everyday articles like pandan (savoury box), surahi (wine flask), huqqa (hubble bubble), etc. The base metal of Bidri is an alloy of zinc, copper and lead on which elaborate inlay is done. Fine wires, as well as pieces of silver, brass and occasionally gold, are inlaid in grooves etched upon the surface of the article which is darkened with chemical treatment, creating a pleasant contrast between the design and ground areas. Popular designs are floral or geometrical patterns and also include motifs like the Swastika - an auspicious symbol in India, the Fish - a royal emblem of Oudh Nawabs, and the Mahipusht - fish scale pattern.
This surahi features an alternating pattern of a pair of fish and vine creepers. It is decorated with the ‘zar-buland’ technique where the metal is laid over a lead pad to provide high relief. Inlay of silver, brass, and copper is common in bidri ware. This piece is rare as it is inlaid with gold.

He was born c. 1597 in The Hague; he travelled to Milan and crossed the Alps in 1614 in the company of the Utrecht artist Terbrugghen; by 1629, after a stay in Amsterdam, he settled in The Hague where, in 1636, he received permission to hold an auction. Thereafter he is unmentioned in documents. The latest known date on a work by him is 1665. In his treatise of 1678, Samuel van Hoogstraten relates that Knibbergen, Jan van Goyen, and Jan Porcellis competed to see who could paint the best landscape in a single day (Knibbergen’s was the largest and depicted mountains, trees, and “dashing” waterfalls) and that Porcellis won.
Knibbergen’s landscapes appear occasionally at the auction but are uncommon in museums; some are signed; only a few are dated. For the most part, they reflect van Goyen’s style and predilection to paint scenes of dunes and rivers. This rare dated example (1630) is of particular importance because it records Knibbergen’s pre-van Goyen style, albeit less Italianate than a presumably still earlier, signed landscape sold at Sotheby’s in 1995. It has been suggested that the small, well-dressed figures and hunch-backed beggar in the foreground of the Tata panel were painted by another artist active in The Hague, Esaias van de Velde, who, like Knibbergen, absorbed elements of Flemish Forest scenes by Gillis van Conixloo and especially David Vinckboons.

DESCRIPTION
This painting is a boisterous and colourful narrative about the nomadic race. The Bohemians, originally natives of Bohemia, gave their name to the free and easy lifestyle so vividly depicted in the painting.
The scene is set against a panoramic view of a desolate mountainous region under a dusky sky. The troupe has travelled a long distance and is now settling down for the night. It is a large group, and some are seen still coming towards the spot, riding on mules, bearing various kinds of goods. Notice that the painting depicts a range of characters, activities and moods, right from childhood to old age.
Daniel Maclise (1806-70) was a leading history painter of his time. He was Irish but worked out of London. In 1829, he exhibited for the first time in the Royal Academy. He was also a caricaturist and is noted for his character portraits. He designed illustrations for several of Dickens’ books and other works. He was commissioned in 1846to paint murals in the House of Lords on such subjects as Justice and Chivalry. His two monumental works, “The Meeting of Wellington and Blucher” and “The Death of Nelson” adorn the walls of Westminster Palace.

Adoration,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Adoration_The-Worshippers.jpg,"Adoration
22.4651
DESCRIPTION
This is an allegorical painting where the representation of an abstract idea is expressed by using specific objects, human figures, and symbols. Here, the female nude symbolizes ideal beauty. We see a soldier wrapped with a spellbound look; an artist kissing her hand with respect; a poet with a raised hand holding a book, probably indicating some verses written in praise; and a gentleman looking at her with interest: all expressions to convey admiration for beauty. The fruits and silverware are gifts that indicate adoration. Rapid brushwork, bright colours and the stark contrast between the figures in the foreground and background is a characteristic feature of this painting.
William Strang (1859-1921) was born at Dumbarton and moved to London when he was sixteen. There he studied art at the Slade School for six years. By the mid-1890s, he had an international reputation as an artist. At first, he concentrated on imaginary allegorical scenes in a pseudo-Venetian manner influenced by his friends, Ricketts and Shannon. Strang produced several paintings, portraits, nude figures in landscapes, and groups of peasant families, which were exhibited at the Royal Academy, the International Society and several German exhibitions. He was one of the original members of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and his work was a part of their first exhibition in 1881.

Vase and Cover,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Vase-and-Cover.jpg,"Vase and Cover
33.1107
DESCRIPTION
The tall vase is of two-handled “water drop” form, with bulbous lower part and long, slender neck. It has a circular foot and stands on a separate stepped plinth, modelled with multiple scrolls, beading, and other motifs. The body is decorated in relief with gilded foliage on a red ground, the rising scroll handles have triangular pierced panels of foliage at their bases, and the neck is modelled with openwork scrolls below the domed ogee cover.
The Royal Crown Derby porcelain factory was founded in 1876 as the Derby Crown Porcelain Company and changed its name following a visit by Queen Victoria in 1890. Like Worcester, Derby had been an important centre of the English china industry since the middle of the 18th century and Royal Crown Derby traced its origins to the factory established in about 1756 by William Duesbury.
The late 19th-century company was particularly known for its display wares. This particular vase, apparently a previously unrecorded shape, is a technical tour de force and typical of the eclecticism of its age. It is extremely thinly constructed, and its plinth is entirely separate. The design is a combination of influences from many different sources. The form of the vase and its high, openwork scroll handles combine elements of gothic revival and Islamic metalwork, while the red body with gilt flowers in more than one colour of gilding is inspired by Japanese lacquer, then extremely sought after in Europe.

Pair of Large Flagons,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pair-of-Large-Flagons.jpg,"Pair of Large Flagons
33.1160, 33.1161
DESCRIPTION
The flagons have bluish-grey bodies with decorative elements picked out in cobalt blue. The tall bodies are of slightly tapering cylindrical form and are divided into three panels, each with a male figure in a landscape, modelled in relief, and with impressed quatrefoil motifs above. Each panel is separated by a grotesque winged creature in relief at the base, a horned mask below the lip, and a garland of foliage between. The broad lip is modelled with further motifs and the angular scroll handle with beaded and serrated ornament.
These imposing flagons are revivals of a type of pouring vessel made in Germany during the 16th and early 17th centuries. Stoneware (so-called because it is fired at a higher temperature than most pottery and is much harder) was produced on an industrial scale and plain utilitarian pots were exported all over Europe. More elaborate and costly wares with fine incised and relief decoration were also made, especially at the potteries of Siegburg and Westerwald, southeast of Cologne.
Decorated stoneware of the 16th century enjoyed a revival of interest among 19th century collectors and changed hands for high prices in the later part of the century. At the same time an enthusiasm for a patriotic “alt deutsch” style in German manufactured goods followed the unification of the Reich in 1871. With official government support, production of Westerwald stoneware in traditional styles was revived and promoted at international exhibitions. Highly original historicist wares from the 1870s onwards are particularly associated with the firms of Merkelbach und Wick and Reinhold Hanke.
The Tata flagons are not signed or marked (other than an incised number, see below) but were possibly made by one or other of these firms. They reflect this renewed antiquarian interest and draw extensively on Renaissance ornament. But they are far from exact copies. The standing figures are dressed in the type of costume seen in early 16th-century portraits by Cranach and his contemporaries; the horned masks on the upper bodies recall elaborate helmets in 16th-century parade armours, and the serrated ornament on the outer face of the handles seems to relate to the kind of silver straps sometimes made to mount such vessels.
The two flagons, although very similar, are not an exact pair and there are a number of small differences between them: one has holes on the handle for a mount, the other does not; one is slightly greyer than the other, and one has a band of laurel beneath the lip while the other has egg-and-dart. One of the two is impressed under the base (before firing) with the number 599.

Damayanti with Hansa,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Damayanti-with-Hansa.jpg,"Damayanti with Hansa
2015.178
DESCRIPTION
The story of Nala-Damayanti is mentioned in the Vana-Parva of Mahabharata. It is also mentioned in Somadev’s ‘Sarit Sagar.’ Shriharsha has written a poem ‘Naishdhiya Charitam’ in Sanskrit.
In the first part of the story, Raja Nala is introduced to and befriends a hamsa, who is impressed with the stature and beauty of the Raja. The hamsa then sings in praise of the beautiful maiden Damayanti to Nala. The hamsa promises Nala that he will praise the Raja in the presence of Damayanti. So the hamsa goes to Damayanti’s place and praises Raja Nala in such a manner that she confesses to having fallen in love with him.
Figurines such as this object seem to be modelled after lithographs made in Germany in the 19th century on Indian subjects.

Bowl,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SatsumaPorcelain-Bowl.jpg,"Bowl
22.650
DESCRIPTION
The extravagantly decorated “Satsuma” ceramics which proved so popular with European and American collectors were equally popular with other late 19th century collectors of taste, and Sir Ratan Tata was no exception. The quality of his Satsuma ceramics collection is of the highest standard as exemplified in this piece.
The decoration of wares in the round is typical of those being produced by Yabu Meizan from the late 1890s until the Japan-British Exhibition at the White City, London in 1910; a bowl with a similar decorative layout was exhibited by Meizan here.1 Despite high sales at these exhibitions, Meizan’s work was exhibited in the “industrial” sections of the fairs and he did not achieve the status of “artist” until the 1904, St. Louis World Fair.
The scene which wraps around the bowl is very painterly in its technique and uses space more economically than those earlier pieces by Meizan which tended to have somewhat crowded decoration. The scene here is of a river running through a hilly landscape with wooded islands on which we see willow trees and Shinto shrines. The boats on the river bear Shinto priests who carry religious symbols decorated with sacred white paper slips – gohei.

Imperial Jade Chime,https://csmvs.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/22.1379-Chinese.jpg,"Imperial Jade Chime
22.1379
DESCRIPTION
Shaped like an inverted “L” resembling a carpenter’s square, this slab of green nephrite is known as a qing, a stone chime, or lithophone. Inscriptions along with the edge date this chime to the 29th year of the reign of the Qianlong emperor, equivalent to 1764 CE, and identify the pitch as taicou. This musical instrument is thus the seventh among a set of 16 imperial stone chimes. Suspended on a rack in two rows of eight each, the chimes made harmonious sounds when struck with a wooden beater and were complemented by a set of bronze bells of similar number. Bells and chimes once played an important musical role in the court rituals of the Qing dynasty.
The qing, identical front, and back, is decorated with a gold lacquer painting of two imperial five-clawed dragons contending for the flaming pearl among clouds. A suspension hole is drilled through the flaming pearl, strung originally with a thick silk cord dyed in imperial yellow.
When China annexed the jade-producing Xinjiang province in the 18th century, large pieces of jade were mined from the mountains of Yarkand. This facilitated the production of larger objects, such as sets of jade chimes.

DESCRIPTION
Inro (literally, “seal basket”) are small containers to keep items like seals and medicines. They were hung on a cord which was passed through a bead called Ojime, then through a decorative toggle called Netsuke which was pushed behind the Obi (sash) of a Kimono to emerge at the top. These came into use during the 17th century and were an important personal accessory for Japanese men of the period. The decoration of inro reflected their wearer’s importance and they were a symbol of his taste, status, and wealth.
Netsuke developed from being strictly utilitarian to an object of extraordinary craftsmanship. The design reflects important aspects of Japanese folklore and life.
